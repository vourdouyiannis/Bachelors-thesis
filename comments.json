If you've lost those antibodies, you *might* be immune (you may well still have the cells that produced those antibodies hanging around, and you may have cell-mediated immunity as well). It's possible that you lose both of those factors, but it's also possible that they last indefinitely in one form or another. If you had an extremely mild infection, it's also possible that you never gained any significant immune response, and so may not be immune.\n\n We don't currently know which of those is the case, but there are some reasons to be optimistic. For understandable reasons, public bodies have been stressing the possibility of not having immunity. Indeed, even if the above didn't exist, they might well still do so - there are a whole bunch of people who think that they have had it based on limited evidence (say, they had a chest infection in December), so it's important to stress to those people that they might not be immune."}, {"id": "fwrri92", "author": "FlawedButFly", "content": "When you say the cells that produced those antibodies, do you mean plasma cells?

There are very strict controls on how the virus is grown starting from X vials of the same master seed bank, which is then expanded to the working seed bank, and how many times the virus can be propagated before you have to restart from older stock.
