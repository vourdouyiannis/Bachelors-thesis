If you are a drug company that rolled out probably the most anticipated vaccine of the past 50 years, do you want to have a bunch of bad press due to people who became sick when they inadvertently got 4 total doses of vaccine (2 from study, 2 after EUA)?  \n\nThe distribution issues are non-trivial, but if I understand it correctly, the Pfizer vaccine requires -80C while the Moderna requires -20C.  I don't see manufacturing to be that big a deal since both of the mRNA vaccines do not have to be grown like the live attenuated vaccines.", "sentiment": 0.3864}, {"id": "gbpuji8", "author": "bullsbarry", "parent_id": "gbpr9zo", "content": "\\-80 C is in the range of temperatures you can get with dry ice, so I'd expect that in the developed world at least this won't be that big of an issue.

But this is a personal opinion.\nSo, let's say that I'm skeptical about human nature in general and about the specific ambitions of pharma companies, universities and governments. I prefer not to develop this too much as we would fall into politics and other considerations (and it would be a different debate itself), but this is mostly my point.\n\nI'm not specifically concerned about this kind of measures being taken under such an urgent situation like the current one, but the fact that these practices can start to be just assumed with not enough debate and that they might last even when this situation is more controlled.\nThe urgency of the situation demand to be flexible and adapt (and researchers are already doing this worldwide: the timelines have very little to do -much quicker- than any previous one and sharing preprints e.g. was not extended in Medicine until this), but we shouldn't miss the point that long-term decisions and standards should be discussed quietly and urgency is not the best criteria for more solid and effective projections.\nAnd it's a fact that there have been abuses and bad praxis in the past both in research (in general) as in some pharma companies.\n\nAdditionally, I think that a too focus on a vaccine scope could neglect other aspects of the fight against the virus, that could be useful too and could have long-term benefits both for public health and to be prepared for future scenarios.\nSometimes I have the feeling that there's a lot of pressure to sort this out asap and close it, while this would be a terrible mistake. We have to learn and introduce improvements, not only on the clinical trial methodology, but in many other things. Imo, some people are failing to understand this, as they are not seeing the problem from a scientific perspective, so they might not be able to see the bigger picture.\nThis threat was something that was warned in advance several times and we had previous 'warnings' that seem to have been dismissed. We cannot afford to make the same mistake again. For instance, multi-resistant bacteria is a threat possible much scarier than CoV-SARS-2 and clinicians and researchers have been warning about them since long ago.\nWe need to design ambitious strategies to be better prepared, so IMO, the focus on speed can somehow distort the importance of this.\n\nOn the other hand, I work in clinical research, so I'm quite aware that wrong decisions on this topics could lead to decrease general trust in research and in science and the historical precedents show that this can result on a very long-standing damage to public health in general. So, simplistic approaches tend to trigger my skepticism, as complex problems demand complex solutions.\n\nAs I said, I accept there are other different criterias to mine and there might always be some of level of disagreement, but these issues shouldn't be focused like a soccer game where some people support a team and the other support their adversary.\nDiversity of criteria and points of view can always be constructive and useful to try to achieve scientific consensus.\nI personally support more the approach defended on this article than the ones focused on speed, but I think this is a valid and interesting discussion that ideally should be done rationally and quietly, leaving emotions and sensationalism aside:\nhttps://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-00751-9", "sentiment": 0.6477}, {"id": "frhzmci", "author": "rookinn", "parent_id": "frhgovl", "content": "I\u2019m sick of this comment.

But said this, I'm currently involved on a few trials about this disease, so my approach is not destructive at all and I believe personal attacks don't add any value to the discussion.\nI have never said that the vaccine is worthless or anything similar.\n\nI just said that I don't think the vaccine looks as promising as was suggested at first, and this is a personal opinion.\nThere was a huge hype and a lot of attention put onto this trial, but there are many others that haven't been receiving the same attention and might be promising too.\n\nThis is what was published (NYT) about a month ago about this trial:\n\n>*The Oxford scientists now say that with an emergency approval from regulators, the first few million doses of their vaccine could be available by September \u2014 at least several months ahead of any of the other announced efforts \u2014 if it proves to be effective.\nNow, they have received promising news suggesting that it might.\nScientists at the National Institutes of Health\u2019s Rocky Mountain Laboratory in Montana last month inoculated six rhesus macaque monkeys with single doses of the Oxford vaccine. **The animals were then exposed to heavy quantities of the virus that is causing the pandemic \u2014 exposure that had consistently sickened other monkeys in the lab. But more than 28 days later all six were healthy**, said Vincent Munster, the researcher who conducted the test.\n\u201cThe rhesus macaque is pretty much the closest thing we have to humans,\u201d Dr. Munster said, noting that scientists were still analyzing the result. He said he expected to share it with other scientists next week and then submit it to a peer-reviewed journal.\nImmunity in monkeys is no guarantee that a vaccine will provide the same degree of protection for humans. A Chinese company that recently started a clinical trial with 144 participants, SinoVac, has also said that its vaccine was effective in rhesus macaques. But with dozens of efforts now underway to find a vaccine, the monkey results are the latest indication that Oxford\u2019s accelerated venture is emerging as a bellwether.*\n\nOf course, we shouldn't take final conclussions from early results in monkey and we should wait for the results in humans.\nBut I personally think that these latest results don't totally match with what it was originally said.\nMarketing is important for clinical trials, as you need to look attractive to get funding and participants, but in my opinion they might have went to far at some stages with this specific trial.\nThere's obviously a lot of pressure and even anxiety to get an effective vaccine asap, but emotions shouldn't be mixed with rationality on these kind of debates.\nAnd the fact of getting downvoted just for expressing that IMO the trial doesn't look as promising as originally sold to the press kinda proves me this point.\n\nI might be totally wrong (i don't dismissed that) but I'm open to be corrected if that's the case.

Contract to popular belief, a vaccine isn't a magical shield. You can still get symptoms when exposed to the virus, it's just much much more mild and for a much shorter duration. So if you expose a few thousand vaccinated young adults to this virus, they can still have mild symptoms, such as a few sniffles, or even a short fever.  This vaccine primes your immune system for a battle--but **that battle still occurs** and hopefully it's over with so quickly that you have no symptoms, or it was just a few sniffles that you thought were allergies.\n\nBut that doesn't tell us anything if upwards of 30% of SARS-CoV-2 infections are already asymptomatic to begin with, and another 50% infections are only very mild in nature. We can't definitively tell whether they recovered quickly because they had the vaccine or just because they're young and healthy. You can even still test positive with an RT-PCR test after being vaccinated. And you can also spread it to other people unknowingly if you were given the virus up your nose and you sneezed on the way home. It's not practical to fully isolate thousands of people for 14-28 days.\n\nThe alternative is to give the challenge to older adults at a large number (N=1000+) where we could truly see if the disease progressed to pneumonia or worse.  The problem here is that if the vaccine doesn't work, then you've just either killed a lot of older people or at best, you've overwhelmed the healthcare system and many other people will die who can't get an ICU bed. The safer and more scientific way is collecting blood plasma and finding neutralizing antibodies which can easily be tested against *in vitro*. That's the money shot, and that can be done without a challenge trial. So far in the Moderna trial, everyone that they've tested so far has developed nAbs that can defeat SARS-CoV-2.

The vaccine causes some kind of immune super-response that makes severe disease more likely even as it protects most people (i.e. your chance of severe disease increases when vaccinated).\n2. The vaccine guards against more moderate cases but there is something about more severe cases that evades the vaccine. Thus a vaccinated person who would otherwise get a severe case still gets a severe case (i.e. your chance of severe disease is unchanged regardless of whether you are vaccinated).\n3. The vaccine provides 94 percent protection against disease but the percentage of people among those who get sick who go on to get severe disease is the same (i.e. your chance of severe disease is reduced by 94 percent)\n4. The vaccine provides 94 percent protection against disease AND the remaining six percent are still less likely to get severe disease (i.e. your chance of severe disease is reduced by 98 percent). \n\nIt seems like the Moderna data points to 3 or 4 but there aren't enough cases yet to know yet which one. Severe disease is still uncommon enough and the vaccine is overall effective enough that we don't know if it's further limiting severe disease beyond its extremely high regular efficacy.\n\nInterestingly, the Oxford vaccine, which had a much higher number of vaccinated people with symptoms, still had no severe disease.

For example when SinoVac says their primary outcome measure is \"The efficacy of Ad5-nCoV in preventing virologically confirmed (PCR positive) COVID-19 disease\" do they mean that they're looking at sick people and then using PCR to confirm that they've been infected with SARS-CoV2 or are they counting a PCR positive test for SARS-CoV2 without symptoms as a case? My guess is the former, since it would be very difficult to screen all participants for infection. It seems like most of these trials are waiting for there to be a certain number of *disease* cases (which, again, means they have symptoms by definition), instead of a certain number of SARS-CoV2 infections.", "sentiment": -0.7346}, {"id": "gcj8zb5", "author": "ShenhuaMan", "parent_id": "gcirnvr", "content": "Right.

However, the secondary endpoints DO include \"Combined incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection.\" Wouldn't that suggest that they are testing everyone for infection, not just waiting for symptomatic cases?  \n\n\nAnti-vaccine groups and websites are already claiming the trials are only testing whether vaccines can stop mild cases, not severe cases or protect against any infection, so general public understanding here matters to get ahead of misinformation.", "sentiment": -0.5587}, {"id": "gcjjvpk", "author": "marmosetohmarmoset", "parent_id": "gcj8zb5", "content": "I don\u2019t want to fuel anti-vaxxers but I also don\u2019t want to make promises that can\u2019t be kept (which also fuels anti-vaxxers).

We assessed the safety, reactogenicity, and immunogenicity of a viral vectored coronavirus vaccine that expresses the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2.\n\n**Methods**\n\nWe did a phase 1/2, single-blind, randomised controlled trial in five trial sites in the UK of a chimpanzee\nadenovirus-vectored vaccine (ChAdOx1 nCoV-19) expressing the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein compared with a meningococcal conjugate vaccine (MenACWY) as control. Healthy adults aged 18\u201355 years with no history of laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection or of COVID-19-like symptoms were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 at a dose of 5\u00d710\u00b9\u2070 viral particles or MenACWY as a single intramuscular injection. A protocol amendment in two of the five sites allowed prophylactic paracetamol to be administered before vaccination. Ten participants assigned to a non-randomised, unblinded ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 prime-boost group received a two-dose schedule, with the booster vaccine administered 28 days after the first dose. Humoral responses at baseline and following vaccination were assessed using a standardised total IgG ELISA against trimeric SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, a muliplexed immunoassay, three live SARS-CoV-2 neutralisation assays (a 50% plaque reduction neutralisation assay [PRNT50]; a microneutralisation assay [MNA50, MNA80, and MNA90]; and Marburg VN), and a pseudovirus neutralisation assay. Cellular responses were assessed using an ex-vivo\ninterferon-\u03b3 enzyme-linked immunospot assay. The co-primary outcomes are to assess efficacy, as measured by cases of symptomatic virologically confirmed COVID-19, and safety, as measured by the occurrence of serious adverse events. Analyses were done by group allocation in participants who received the vaccine. Safety was assessed over 28 days after vaccination. Here, we report the preliminary findings on safety, reactogenicity, and cellular and humoral immune responses. The study is ongoing, and was registered at ISRCTN, 15281137, and ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04324606.\n\n**Findings**\n\nBetween April 23 and May 21, 2020, 1077 participants were enrolled and assigned to receive either\nChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (n=543) or MenACWY (n=534), ten of whom were enrolled in the non-randomised ChAdOx1\nnCoV-19 prime-boost group. Local and systemic reactions were more common in the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 group and\nmany were reduced by use of prophylactic paracetamol, including pain, feeling feverish, chills, muscle ache, headache, and malaise (all p<0\u00b705). There were no serious adverse events related to ChAdOx1 nCoV-19. In the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 group, spike-specific T-cell responses peaked on day 14 (median 856 spot-forming cells per million peripheral blood mononuclear cells, IQR 493\u20131802; n=43). Anti-spike IgG responses rose by day 28 (median 157 ELISA units [EU], 96\u2013317; n=127), and were boosted following a second dose (639 EU, 360\u2013792; n=10).

Early introduction of antibodies can disrupt the specific immune context involved in provoking the desired response by affecting phenotype selection, protein expression, antigen presentation etc., and there's some evidence that the context of those factors contributes directly to immunopathology associated with poor outcomes in COVID-19.\n\n[A proteomic analysis](https://www.cell.com/cell/pdf/S0092-8674(20)30627-9.pdf) published recently in Cell identified that differential genetic expression causes anti-inflammatory macrophages to instead induce pro-inflammatory cytokines leading to inflammatory cascade; the researchers, in line with mechanisms proposed by other researchers and [studied in SARS immunology](https://www.pnas.org/content/117/26/15160), observed that improper binding to the complement system of IgG produced by patients with severe disease was the primary contributing factor to that change in protein expression - in short, that high, early levels of IgG in certain circumstances affect changes to the immune system which cause the cytokine storm, similar to the immunopathology that causes FEC to become FIP. There's corresponding evidence that similar circumstances contribute to endothelial permeabilization associated with blood clotting dysfunction.\n\nAnother example: [in FIP](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1016/j.jfms.2008.09.008?casa_token=6Be-F8tRKO4AAAAA:J9un_nu2DuHwVc339p-v0u3g78my6bZ1kZih6dblVw3DBgOaxJUwKQgrn3CJOQ2RMLFg_fcUpMUTB8I), the difference in early immune response has a noted effect on pathology. If the cellular response develops early, T cells receive signals which increase their effectiveness and a more effective immune response occurs. If the humoral response develops early, the cellular response can fail to properly develop while antibodies simultaneously enhance the infection, resulting in severe pathology. There are many similarities and some key differences between COVID-19 and FIP, but we can look at the above model and see why it might actually be preferable for a vaccine to promote a relatively weak initial antibody response while the body's newly produced T cells adapt to better neutralize the pathogen. \n\nOther antibody-mediated immunological consequences which can affect the function of the cellular immune response are quite common; a vaccine might avoid certain aspects of such antibody mediation in order to produce a highly effective immune response.\n\nedit: u/tooper432, answered your question somewhat here.", "sentiment": 0.9311}, {"id": "fyp7pe8", "author": "MineToDine", "parent_id": "fyouzuh", "content": "Thanks for the insights in your comment.

I do see higher day-7 IgG titers in the 100ug dose, which could reasonably predict an inverse correlation with T cell levels. \n\nTypically, due to the impact of dose on production of both responses, I believe you'd expect dose-dependent Ab dynamics to produce a more marked difference in T cell performance than in total levels. So your feeling that the result was strange isn't way off, although particular dynamics in the impact of IgG levels on T cell production may in this case offer an explanation.\n\nEdit: it's an old paper, but check out 'New Concepts of AMI' [here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC523044/) for an overview on some direct mechanisms by which antibodies can mediate cellular immunity.", "sentiment": 0.6448}, {"id": "fypcgvc", "author": "MineToDine", "parent_id": "fypahbg", "content": "This is the Pfizer/BioNTec paper from today -  https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.17.20140533v1.full.pdf+html\n\nCD4+ is better in the 1ug group than all other doses, CD8+ is marginally lower in the 1ug dose than 50ug, but markedly lower in the other doses.\nMaybe unrelated, but the CRP and lymphocyte graphs look a bit odd to me in the higher doses.

Well, at first glance, that's quite frankly not a good sign - lymphopenia and upregulated CRP are associated with macrophage recruitment into cytokine production and are established biomarkers for severe pathology in COVID-19. The higher doses may be too high or may have dynamics which promote enhancement of pro-inflammatory immunoregulatory pathways, because a CRP spike is primarily associated with severe (not even moderate) pathology.\n\nI'll dive into it here in just a bit and get back to you.\n\nu/MineToDine, yeah, my reading is that the upper-end doses are probably too high (maybe because they're trying to jack up that neutralizing response) - you can see that they didn't boost the 50ug dose likely for this reason.\n\nThe cytokine responses they're seeing are quite high, lining up with the enhanced cytokine induction identified in [this paper](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.13.190140v1) when lung macrophages are exposed to both viral stimuli and anti-Spike IgG immune complexes which I found a bit surprising. However it looks like inflammation might successfully be offset by the increase in regulatory interleukins, in which case the cytokine levels could be helpful rather than harmful and results there might indicate appropriate balancing of immune activation and suppression of inflammation.\n\nThe upregulated CRP with lymphopenia occurs and bounces back prior to interaction with IgG, but those initial seven days look more similar to what's seen in severe than in mild patients - which, again, could be good for resulting immunity if associated damage is controlled and inflammatory cascade avoided. To that end, typically upregulated CRP with lymphopenia is associated with severe infection, but you'd expect slightly higher level of interleukins while the CRP/lymphopenia trend continued whereas the rebound here likely signals an appropriate adaptive response that would prevent inflammatory cascade.\n\nTo actually answer your question, though, I have no idea why the 1ug results would not follow the dose curve.

A crucial difference is that mice do not express human ACE2 receptor, and have been made to do so by an initial adenoviral infection to place hACE2 on the surface of respiratory cells. \n* Intranasal immunisation is always better than parenteral (putting it \"somewhere else\") immunisation, because it stimulates mucosal immune cells directly. This sends antigen straight to the draining mediastinal lymph node and sends mucosal-homing T cells back to the lung, and is great for establishing lung-resident memory. Definitely more effective. Also can carry some drastically worse side-effects, depending on the degree of inflammation caused by the immunisation. The authors haven't shown weight loss, but it can be up to 5-10% before they hit their ethical endpoint. That's in inbred mice - natural outbred populations can have much more extreme reactions.\n* The most exciting thing besides abolishing viral replication is also the reduction in cytokine mRNA. A more controlled (less extreme) immune response is precisely what we're looking for, besides just sterilising the lungs. Having said that, they only looked at mRNA without protein quantification, which is only half useful as there is a lot of post-transcriptional regulation of cytokine translation and release, they also normalised to GAPDH which is kind of a no-no.\n\nInteresting and decent study - but not exciting just yet.", "sentiment": 0.9955}, {"id": "g25yabr", "author": "subterraniac", "parent_id": "g24v7p9", "content": "Immunity plus weight loss?

From March 2020 to September 2021, the Faroe Islands had registered only 1,001 cases of COVID-19 (1,867 per 100,000) and two deaths (3.73 per 100,000). However, after loosening restrictions and the introduction of the more contagious Delta variant, a large outbreak has plagued the islands, with more than 3.300 cases and 11 deaths registered during the last two and a half months [9].  **This paper reports a super-spreading event where 21 of 33 healthcare workers were infected with the Omicron variant after attending a social gathering in early December 2021, even though all infected participants had been vaccinated three times and had a recent negative test.**", "sentiment": -0.7778}, {"id": "hpsuzpi", "author": "Garglebarghests", "parent_id": "rniu0a", "content": "They say they had a booster dose within the last 2.5 months.

Based on the \"best\" antibody data we have that I am aware of, which are generally Pfizer and Moderna's press releases of their ongoing clinical trial results, antibodies start out much lower against variants like Beta and Delta and reduce from there. But also note that a 3rd dose booster produces a much higher antibody level against the variants than even the original 2-dose regime did against the original disease manifestation.\n\nimgur.com/a/lfDUORa\n\nimgur.com/a/YIPPRr7\n\nhttps://s21.q4cdn.com/317678438/files/doc_financials/2021/q2/Q2-2021-Earnings-Charts-FINAL.pdf\n\n(Slides 25 - 27)\n\n(By \"best\" data, I mean \"the most representative dataset\". This is not necessarily the same as the most peer-reviewed and fully published COVID dataset available, which is what defines \"best\" to many others. But I think it is a mistake to over-privilege the most peer-reviewed datasets when their underlying data don't represent the Delta timeframe, or when the most peer-reviewed study that reports high efficacy against Delta was studied only on a relatively recently vaccinated population. This is the fault of many hot takes going around on the different efficacy data reported in different areas).\n\nModerna's antibody data tells a similar story: smaller protection to start with against the variants that wanes from there (Moderna does have a higher antibody starting point that delays waning some though), and 3rd dose boosters skyrocket those low antibody levels up to much higher than they ever were. Here's actual papers on that.\n\nimgur.com/a/qjBffR6\n\nimgur.com/a/OFjiryX\n\nhttps://science.sciencemag.org/content/early/2021/08/11/science.abj4176\n\nhttps://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.05.05.21256716v1.full-text\n\nNow that we know generally where the antibody count is at for a certain timepoint for a certain variant, it is useful to compare to the best data I know of on \"how high of an antibody level do you need to produce a certain percentage of protection against symptomatic illness\". (Using only antibodies to predict protection in absence of T-cell or B-cell data provokes groans from some, since typically they contribute to protection too. But as it turns out for COVID-19 symptomatic illness, by far the largest predictive role goes purely to the antibody level. This is why papers like this one could track and even predict other vaccine's efficacy against symptomatic illness just by assessing the antibody levels alone).\n\nimgur.com/a/eAqpYkU\n\nhttps://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.03.09.21252641v1.full.pdf\n\nSo finally, this paper shows how your level of antibodies relates to protection against symptomatic illness as antibody levels wane over time.\n\nimgur.com/a/6nNxA2v\n\nhttps://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.08.09.21261290v1.full.pdf\n\nI would not take the exact numbers as prescriptive, just the order of magnitudes and the general shape of the curve. But you can compare that graph to the press release antibody titer graph from the two companies. That lets you get an idea of how effective the waning antibody levels are vs the boosted levels (being careful not to confuse pseudovirus titers and live virus titers...generally different assays make it hard to compare different antibody papers directly, which is why that paper above normalized to the fraction of convalescent sera's protection).\n\nSo anyway, when I take all that antibody data and compare it to the various efficacy data coming out from Israel, it becomes clear to me that waning is most likely a real thing that is happening. In absence of looking at the antibody data like this, I see how others come to different conclusions from just looking at efficacy data--Nate Silver outlined the challenges that can make those datasets noisy and imperfectly predictive here...\n\nimgur.com/a/rMYCx8V\n\n...but with antibody data included, the most parsimonious story involves antibody waning to some degree. Even the higher starting protection from Moderna will drop off a cliff the same as Pfizer, maybe not too long afterward based on that curve above. \n\nSo I wish we would pivot quicker to telling folks that, yes waning will happen in 6-8 months, which will impact much if not most of your protection against symptomatic illness from COVID-19. But you can get a 3rd dose booster to completely fix that issue if you choose to avoid sickness and any risk of Long Covid. And even if you don't want a 3rd dose, your severe disease protection will stay pretty solid with just 2 doses.", "sentiment": 0.9552}, {"id": "h9czlbg", "author": "Cyclonis123", "parent_id": "h9a0n1i", "content": "> But you can get a 3rd dose booster to completely fix that issue if you choose to avoid sickness and any risk of Long Covid\n\nWhy does a 3rd shot have such a dramatic effect?

Why does it produce so many more antibodies relative to the first two shots? I don't know at all, but I can speculate. I know it is what we would have predicted based on other vaccine schedules with 3 doses like the Hepatitis A shot. \n\nWith those shots, I gather you are meant to wait 6 months in between certain doses specifically in order to maximize affinity maturation of the B-cells (part of the typical long term immune system response). The idea is, if you did not wait 6 months for affinity maturation to complete, then the massive circulation of antibodies produced by shot #3 would swamp the antigen on its own and prevent the B-cells from having any targets left to further optimize its affinity maturation. So we space them that way because we expect this kind of antibody explosion.\n\nhttp://pgnrc.sbmu.ac.ir/uploads/Rationale_for_the_Immunization_Schedule.pdf\n\n(With COVID-19, so far T-cells and B-cells are shown to be present, but their roles are less clearly defined relative to the acute antibody response from a shot/exposure. I would be out of my depth summarizing their roles as of current science, but I know the podcast TWiV 791 had a good discussion on T-cell papers that came out recently).\n\n> And will it not weaken 6-8 months after the shot same as with the second?\n\nThe million $ question. I don't know this either, and could only speculate. I would expect it to weaken at some future time point, because your body always lets antibodies fade away eventually.\n\n(Ostensibly the long term immune response takes over in non-COVID-19 related diseases, but as described earlier the T and B cell response so far doesn't seem to do much to protect against symptomatic illness from COVID over the long term. Although 1) T and B cells roles are not ruled out for more minor assistance 2) maybe their protection will continue to improve over a timeframe we haven't lived long enough to study yet and 3) T and B cells could very well already be providing long-lived protection against severe disease, just not symptomatic illness. In fact, I would assume so).\n\nSo I would expect weakening from normal antibody waning, and I would also expect weakening from antigenic drift from new variants. How often will this occur? Dunno either. The first year of COVID, we didn't get much significant mutation at all. The second year, we got several variants with impact (though in the grand scheme, nothing widely transmitting that reduces the original mRNA vaccines below 88% effectiveness when your antibody titers have not waned. That's really outstanding news from that POV).\n\nIf we take it that we will get a similar curve of antibody decay and a similar timeframe of mutations, then yeah needing a booster every 6-12 months to prevent symptomatic illness would be one guess. In that universe, from a public health POV, you will never convince most of the world to get a shot every 6-12 months indefinitely. But from an individual health standpoint, absolutely there are people who would get a shot every 6 months to have a normal life otherwise (I would, or at least until a better intervention comes along like the hopeful intranasal vaccines). \n\nTiny reason to be more positive: look again at this graph.\n\nimgur.com/a/lfDUORa\n\nSee how the antibodies go up from 7 days after dose 3 to a month after dose 3? That has never happened before with the mRNA vaccines, they usually start to drop immediately.

It has been shown in many studies that sars-cov-2 virions are temperature-sensitive and less active / infectious in warm environments. Hence, the results of this manuscript may reflect a seasonal pattern in infectivity. The authors may want to control for this statistically by either (1) using a matched design of samples from similar dates; (2) include historical temperature data for the Netherlands as a covariate / proxy for this likely bias.

Also ChAdOx is technically not a LAV but in fact a viral vector (Chimp Adenovirus) vaccine that uses non replicating Adenovirus with Spike protein on its surface to illicit a response. \n\nRegarding the users question, if one had been infected I believe vaccination would potentially boostedimmune response as the initial infection would essentially act as a prime. As the immune system would not mount a response to the mRNA but to the subsequent translated spike protein you would still get a immune response to that. Similarly in the case of the ChAdOx vaccine you would mount a second response to the spike protein. The data has suggested a prime boost inducing a stronger response with ChAdOx supports this.

It is noteworthy that the disease has its greatest impact on the elderly. Herein, we investigated the potential of childhood vaccination, specifically against measles, mumps and rubella (MMR), to identify if this could potentially confer acquired protection over SARS-CoV-2. We identified sequence homology between the fusion proteins of SARS-CoV-2 and measles and mumps viruses. Moreover, we also identified a 29% amino acid sequence homology between the Macro (ADP-ribose-1\u2019\u2019-phosphatase) domains of SARS-CoV-2 and rubella virus. The rubella Macro domain has surface-exposed conserved residues and is present in the attenuated rubella virus in MMR. Hence, we hypothesize that MMR could protect against poor outcome in COVID-19 infection. As an initial test of this hypothesis, we identified that 1) age groups that most likely lack of MMR vaccine-induced immunity had the poorest outcome in  COVID-19, and 2) COVID-19 disease burden correlates with rubella antibody titres, potentially induced by SARS-CoV2 homologous sequences. We therefore propose that vaccination of \u2018at risk\u2019 age groups with an MMR vaccination merits further consideration as a time appropriate and safe intervention.    \n   https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.10.20053207   \n  Conclusion    \n    \n  SARS-CoV2 Spike glycoproteins are class I viral membrane fusion proteins that share structural similarities with the Fusion proteins from both measles and mumps viruses. The Macro domains of SARS-CoV-2 and rubella virus share 29% amino acid sequence identity. Interestingly, the residues conserved in the SARS-CoV-2 and rubella Macro domains include surface-exposed residues and are present in the attenuated rubella virus used in the MMR vaccine. We identified at a population level that both older populations and males are both more likely to die from COVID-19, and less likely to be seropositive for rubella-specific immunity, based on historical vaccination programmes of all three countries considered in this report. Finally, the hypothesis that this macro domain could be recognised by antibodies raised against rubella was supported by data that demonstrated that patients who have SARS-CoV2 infection had raised levels of rubella IgG to a level in keeping with secondary rubella infection. Taken together, we suggest that MMR will not prevent COVID-19 infection but could potentially reduce poor outcome. To conclude whether MMR vaccination can improve the outcomes from Covid-19 infection, a study using individual based data to compare MMR immunity status in the affected population is warranted.   \n  ***An Indian Pediatrician wrote this published one page letter to the Journal Indian Pediatrics suggesting that declining effectiveness of the MMR vaccine with age is responsible for the increased death rate from COVID-19 among older individuals.***   \n   Author:  Varnit Shanker   \n  [https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s13312-020-1804-z.pdf](https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s13312-020-1804-z.pdf)   \n   Measles Immunization: Worth Considering Containment Strategy for SARS-CoV-2 Global Outbreak      \n  Age-related declining immunogenicity of measles vaccine, possible structural and functional similarities between measles virus and SARS-CoV-2, sparing of young population from the clinically symptomatic cohort, and importantly, no other plausible immunological explanation of COVID-19 being a predominantly adult age group disease warrants serious probing of measles vaccine as a containment strategy during this ongoing pandemic. Measles vaccination carries a number of advantages: highly efficient, safe, easily manufactured at large scale, vaccine strains are genetically stable, measles does not recombine or integrate genetic material, vaccine does not persist or diffuse, mass booster doses can be given to both pediatric and adult population, and it presents an economical option that can be evaluated swiftly in times of crisis.      \n  ***Two medical research scientists from Louisiana State University and  Tulane University  encourage MMR vaccine for use as a preventative measure against severe outcomes of COVID-19.

There is mounting evidence that live attenuated vaccines, including MMR, provides protection against lethal infections unrelated to measles, mumps, or rubella. Aside from adaptive immunity, it has been postulated that live attenuated vaccines also induce \u2018trained\u2019 non-specific innate immunity for improved antimicrobial function. Work from our laboratory demonstrated that vaccination with a live attenuated fungal strain induces trained innate protection against lethal polymicrobial sepsis. The protection is mediated by myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) reported to inhibit sepsis and mortality in several experimental models.

WHO defined China and Italy as the epicenters for COVID-19. Insufficient vaccine coverage has been identified as a key causative factor in the most epidemic outbreaks. Vaccines generally raise specific immune responses to a targeted pathogen, but measles vaccines have recently proved the increased ability of the immune system to fight off pathogens other than measles. COVID-19 is proven to have similarities with measles. Such similarities may cause cross-reactivity between measles vaccines and COVID-19. For instance, comparing China and Italy for COVID-19 case and the death rates from late 2019 until Mars 25, 2020, Italy showed higher ratio of COVID19 cases/population and a higher death rate than China. In contrast, Italy showed lower measles vaccination coverage than China. In this review, we hypothesized that the bystander immunity induced by measles vaccines may provide partial protection against COVID-19, decreasing the virus\u2019s ability to cause fatal symptoms and controlling the infection leading to full recovery. Accordingly, we suggest multi-center clinical trials to evaluate the possibility of induced partial protection by measles-containing vaccines against COVID-19.      \n     \n   [https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/record/NCT04357028](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/record/NCT04357028)    \n   Sponsor:  Kasr El Aini Hospital  Information provided by:  Ahmed Mukhtar, Kasr El Aini Hospital    \n   This is a current clinical trial conducted in Egypt  Cairo University Hospital\t  Cairo, Egypt, 11559  Contact: Ahmed M Mukhtar, M.D      Sub-Investigator: Abeer Ahmed, MD            Sub-Investigator: Mostafa Alfishawy, MD            Sub-Investigator: Doaa Ghaith, MD            Sub-Investigator: Marwa Rashad, MD       \n   Brief Summary:    \nTill now, mortality reports among children below 9 years remains extremely low despite that the incidence of death toll is high and exceeding 50,000 patients among older population, One speculation for lower SARS infectivity is that cross-protective antibodies against measles vaccine ( MV).

There was a bit of an overreaction from certain journalists, but also legitimate questions. Here's the takeaway:\n\n1. Instituto Butantan has received the revised report of the Brazilian arm of the research from Austrian researchers, and they considered the results a success.\n\n2. There was a press conference to announce this. It was not intended was a scientific event, just as an announcement to the public, because it is a public institution. Compare it to a company message to shareholders. \n\n3. The only numbers presented were 78% efficacy for \"mild cases\", 100% for \"severe cases\". No raw numbers, no confidence interval. The 100% number for severe cases is particularly misleading, because it is likely based on few cases.\n\n4. Journalists were understandably unsatisfied, and asked for more data. There was a bit of an uncomfortable situation in the conference, and under pressure, the director of the institute gave the number of Covid cases found in the main and in the control groups from memory, but it wasn't meant as official data. He promised the full study would be released soon, after the preliminary review from the national health agency. Confidence interval for the 78% number was released in a promotional video a bit later, but journalists that were there didn't see it immediately.\n\n5. A few journalists that have no experience with scientific studies decided to \"reverse engineer\" the \"real efficacy\" from the two numbers informally presented by the Butantan director in response to a question. They started to treat as fact a lower, ~62% efficacy, a number that they calculated themselves without access to the study and without taking into account possible differences in sample sizes, stratification etc.\n\n6. Treating this apocryphal number as fact, more journalists concluded that the Butantan had excluded infection cases from the results. Most seemed to be under the impression that phase 3 trials submit all participants to regular RNA testing, which is obviously not true. Symptoms are the first trigger. This impression was somewhat reinforced by some of the specialists interviewed by the press, but they also didn't have any involvement with the study.\n\n7. A competent journalist working for the University of S\u00e3o Paulo reached out to someone who was actually in the study, and this researcher said that the Brazilian study used the [WHO progression scale](https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/documents/emergencies/minimalcoreoutcomemeasure.pdf) for Covid symptoms / infection, 0 being no virus found; 1 - asymptomatic; 2 - symptomatic, independent; 3 - Symptomatic, assistance needed, 4 - hospitalized etc. According to this [source](https://jornal.usp.br/ciencias/eficaz-em-prevenir-doenca-grave-e-morte-por-covid-coronavac-deve-ter-impacto-em-frear-pandemia/), only level 3 and higher qualified. Level 1 was generally excluded from phase 3 trials, but at least part of level 2 cases were included in other studies. It is unclear whether this was the criteria for triggering tests from the start, or if existing cases were deliberately excluded from yesterday's report (which would confirm the suspicions of aforementioned journalists). This is unclear because the [study protocols](https://static-content.springer.com/esm/art%3A10.1186%2Fs13063-020-04775-4/MediaObjects/13063_2020_4775_MOESM1_ESM.pdf) state that participants were instructed to immediately \"report fever or any symptoms that could be linked to Covid-19\"; after that, they would be tested and directed to a physician for clinical assessment. Thus, every participant reporting symptoms would have been subjected to medical assistance, rendering meaningless the distinction between level 2 and level 3 cases, which is based on the idea that people with lesser symptoms will not seek medical help.\n\nIn sum, while I'd rather have the full study available as soon as possible, a few journalists were very irresponsible in spreading unofficial numbers they figured out for themselves. I can see that a press conference without full results isn't the best scenario, but this is hardly the first time it's happened with Covid vaccines. We'll have to wait for the results after they come back from regulators, or maybe the Butantan Institute will clear some of these things up. \n\nTo be honest, I don't believe they're being malicious. It's just that Sinovac is very strict with what numbers can and cannot be published by the Brazilian arm alone. It is known that efficacy in Turkey was higher, probably because in Brazil tests were conducted with frontline health workers, which are probably more exposed to the virus than the general population. Sinovac doesn't want the Brazilian numbers to become their whole numbers, it could affect stock prices and whatnot. Brazilians want to get the numbers out there as soon as possible, because they're good enough to grant the vaccine emergency use authorization.\n\nEdit: Added a link to the study's protocols to explain what exactly is unclear about the reported cases", "sentiment": -0.9838}, {"id": "gilqvqr", "author": "east_62687", "parent_id": "gikh7ef", "content": ">Confidence interval for the 78% number was released in a promotional video a bit later\n  \nwhat is the confidence interval in the video?

But this is not a matter of opinion, it's scientific fact.\n\n> Vaccines are a marvel of medicine. Few interventions can claim to have saved as many lives. But it may surprise you to know that not all vaccines provide the same level of protection. Some vaccines stop you getting symptomatic disease, but others stop you getting infected too. The latter is known as \u201csterilising immunity\u201d. With sterilising immunity, the virus can\u2019t even gain a toehold in the body because the immune system stops the virus entering cells and replicating.\n\n> There is a subtle yet important difference between preventing disease and preventing infection. A vaccine that \u201cjust\u201d prevents disease might not stop you from transmitting the disease to others \u2013 even if you feel fine. But a vaccine that provides sterilising immunity stops the virus in its tracks.\n\n> In an ideal world, all vaccines would induce sterilising immunity. In reality, it is actually extremely difficult to produce vaccines that stop virus infection altogether. Most vaccines that are in routine use today do not achieve this. For example, vaccines targeting rotavirus, a common cause of diarrhoea in infants, are only capable of preventing severe disease.

A that you're trying to use as some kind of counter evidence against my statements on IM vaccines effects on transmission supports what I wrote (that Intramuscular vaccines typically do not prevent onwards transmission entirely) So it doesn't run contrary to what I stated at all. Additionally Hep. A is not a respiratory viral infection, unlike covid. I specifically mentioned respiratory viral infections in talking about why IM vaccine are expected to be more more limited compared to intranasal. Published data (including data specific to covid vaccine candidates) supports my statement. \n\n2) you use an old quote about forthcoming AZ data , data that's said is expected *might* show a reduction in transmission (not a prevention) you use that as evidence that you're beating a dead horse..? \n\nThe actual data has been published now, if you were paying attention. It showed a 4% reduction in onward tranmission with the standard regimen, substantially less than the efficacy. (Moderna, and pfizer are also predicted by their own insiders, ceos to have more limited reduction on transmission vs their published efficacy) I \n\nIf somebody told you a mask \"prevents\" covid infection based on one clinical trial that showed a 4% reduction in infection would you have a problem with that? I would. Various advertising agencies and regulatory bodies would too I'm.sure\n\n  It's not semantics, it's about standards. And ethics. This is science, medicine.   The best available data now indicates reduction, not wholesale prevention is what we can expect. Either way we cannot really make a concrete statement.  it's fair to say what I said that  transmission 'may be possible'.  Just because you don't like it doesn't mean it's not true and it certainly is not misinformation like you said it was. \n\nYou can't be going round telling people that they are prevented from transmission once vaccinated when the evidence is lacking. It's potentially dangerous. And you're acting like it's the mainstream consensus of scientists. You're doing it on the scientific sub where people, perhaps a fair few of them, lacking strong scientific knowledge come to learn. They come to get factual, verifiable information from experts instead of the mass of junk on fb of wherever else. \n\nWould you be happy if 15 people who had read this thread remembered your words and then went out and socialized with their grandma's after receiving the vaccine, safe in the knowledge they had read an experts comments on a science sub about how the possibility of transmission after being vaccinated was \"misinformation\"? \n\n i'm not trying to be hyperbolic or extreme but stupider things have happened.

When you slim down the timeline of the temporal associations, you get a higher relative increase with all vaccination within 1-2 doses compared to the 2-5x relative increase women get with using contraceptives for a year straight.\n\nThe question you are supposed to ask is: If you select x amount of random people in Europe and follow them for 14 days, and you give Vaxzevria to x amount of random people in Europe and follow them for 14 days; what is the risk ratio of developing CVST between the groups?\n\nThe question is not: If you follow 100,000 women in Europe while they take contraceptives over the entire year and then follow 100,000 people for 14 days after taking Vaxzevria; what is the risk of developing thrombosis in the contraceptives group compared to the risk of developing CVST in the Vaxzevria group?\n\nObviously it's going to be more frequent, when you ask the second question, because the period of time is longer in one comparator. Divide it by 24 and you'll get closer, but not close at all, because it's a different pathology.\n\nSo let's get it straight. Adjusting for time period. As of April 4, 169 cases of CVST were reported in individuals, shortly after vaccination. At that time 34 million people were vaccinated with Vaxzevria. That gives you a 0.5/100,000\\~ probability of developing CVST per on average 2 weeks post administration. [The baseline rate for CVST per year is 1.47/100,000](https://iovs.arvojournals.org/article.aspx?articleid=2690377). Assuming each temporal association of CVST happened on average within two weeks of vaccination you adjust the per year measure to be bi-monthly, which gives you 0.06125/100,000 cases per two weeks with the baseline. The relative risk increase from vaccination therefore is 8x\\~ and this is CVST, which is far more serious, than the blood clots women present with after taking oral contraceptives. This is still in line with what the EMA said back in march. They said 1.35 cases of CVST would've been expected, but there were 12 cases with the same temporal cut-off, around a 9x\\~ relative increase.\n\nSource for the two week association: [https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/news/astrazenecas-covid-19-vaccine-ema-finds-possible-link-very-rare-cases-unusual-blood-clots-low-blood](https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/news/astrazenecas-covid-19-vaccine-ema-finds-possible-link-very-rare-cases-unusual-blood-clots-low-blood)\n\nEdit: RR calc", "sentiment": 0.6543}, {"id": "gu8fd3b", "author": "StorkReturns", "parent_id": "gu7wko5", "content": "You are right with the temporal differences but on the other hand, vaccine is supposedly a one time event or at worst a once a year one (if there are going to be boosters), while contraceptives are long term.

When infected naturally a person is usually exposed to a small amount of virus and it takes time for the reproductive process to happen and thus spreads the exposure out over time. When vaccinated presumably a larger amount of mRNA modifying chemical is introduced in an instantaneous exposure event which compresses this into a shorter time period, which cookie be compounded but the fact that your immune system has zero prior exposure and thus no mechanism to respond at that instance (which isn't necessarily the truth for an infected person due to the time it takes to build a viral load).\n\n2.

These estimates are consistent or even faster than doubling times reported from South Africa (13). Assuming an exponentially distributed generation time of 5.2 days and that R=1 currently for Delta, reproduction number (R) estimates for Omicron are above 3 for the SGTF and genotype analyses, and above 2.5 even for the period 8th -10th December. Shorter assumed generation times will give lower R estimates. The distribution of Omicron by age, region and ethnicity currently differs markedly from Delta, indicating Omicron transmission is not yet uniformly distributed across the population. However, we note that given its immune evasion, the age distribution of Omicron infection in the coming weeks may continue to differ from that of Delta. London is substantially ahead of other English regions in Omicron frequency. We find strong evidence of immune evasion, both from natural infection, where the risk of reinfection is 5.41 (95% CI: 4.87-6.00) fold higher for Omicron than for Delta, and from vaccine-induced protection. Our VE estimates largely agree with those from UKHSA\u2019s TNCC study (11) and predictions from predicting VE from neutralising antibody titres (4,14), suggesting very limited remaining protection against symptomatic infection afforded by two doses of AZ, low protection afforded by two doses of Pfizer, but moderate to high (55-80%) protection in people boosted with an mRNA vaccine. Our estimate of the hazard ratio for reinfection relative to Delta also supports previous analysis of reinfection risk in South Africa (15). Prior to Omicron, the SIREN cohort study of UK healthcare workers estimated that SARS-CoV-2 infection gave 85% protection against reinfection over 6 months (16), or a relative risk of infection of 0.15 compared with those with no prior infection. Our hazard ratio estimate would suggest the relative risk of reinfection has risen to 0.81 \\[95%CI: 0.73-1.00\\] (i.e. remaining protection of 19% \\[95%CI: 0-27%\\]) against Omicron. We find no evidence (for both risk of hospitalisation attendance and symptom status) of Omicron having different severity from Delta, though data on hospitalisations are still very limited. There are several limitations of this analysis. While case numbers are increasing quickly, there are still limits in our ability to examine interactions between the variables considered. The distribution of Omicron differed markedly from Delta across the English population at the time this analysis was conducted, likely due to the population groups in which it was initially seeded, which increases the risks of confounding in analyses. SGTF is an imperfect proxy for Omicron, though SGTF had over 60% specificity for Omicron over the date range analysed in the SGTF analysis (and close to 100% by 10th December). Intensified contact tracing around known Omicron cases may have increased case ascertainment over time, potentially introducing additional biases. Our analysis reinforces the still emerging but increasingly clear picture that Omicron poses an immediate and substantial threat to public health in England and more widely.", "sentiment": -0.734}, {"id": "hp25tkc", "author": "Bluest_waters", "parent_id": "hp23yve", "content": "> We find no evidence (for both risk of hospitalisation attendance and symptom status) of Omicron having different severity from Delta, **though data on hospitalisations are still very limited**.\n \nIsn't hospitalization rates a large part of how severity is measured though?

Now, imagine the organism that is your primary reservoir for survival fights back both with the old school physiological responses millions of years old but also utilizes both physical barriers to transmission AND vaccines to keep you from surviving.\n\nAnd so, you face these challenges to your continued existence. What do you do? Yes, I realize I am engaging in anthropomorphism, but the bottom line is pretty much the above and Omicron is the outcome.\n\nI have studied and researched a great deal over the years on pandemic organisms and how they \"work.\" Frankly, as a tip of the spear epi and not an academic one, I don't care about the genomic details except as I need to understand some aspect of population penetration and sequelae. Some of the best research that gets at the things I am concerned about are bird pandemic organisms that have been followed from coast to coast with analysis of how the organisms have changed during the course of the pandemic.\n\nSome generalizations, observations I have come to see are that IF they are virulent, they become less so as they spread through a naive population. Any advantage to survival no matter how slight will TEND to reduce virulence and enhance transmission. And it can happen surprisingly quickly. And don't forget the two main Coronaviruses that we live with, as a population, that are primarily a seasonal PITA in the present.\n\nI'm surprised that I am not reading anything on what happened to SARS? Why did it change from a very efficient killing machine to essentially disappearing as an extant threat? Why is MERS not able to make that transition from what it is to something like Covid? Heck, what happened to syphilis to turn it from what it was to the sexually transmitted slow motion killer it is now days? I can't find those journal articles...\n\nBut I do remember one article I'm trying to find where a bird virus started in the east somewhat virulent then became less so extremely quickly to the point where it was almost benign as it got to the west coast... AND then for some reason became much more virulent again as it ran into the physical barrier of the ocean and a reservoir where the burden became close to 100% and the animals susceptible and with certain characteristics died while others live... AT that point the virus became very virulent just before essentially disappearing as distinct antagonistic organism to certain bird populations. I also look at things like CCR5 and can see how WE as a species have reacted to existential threats...\n\nMuch of the research I see is down at the levels of the genome and after someone develops the desriptive epi associated with an organism, so little seems to be done at other levels. For example, I am not surprised that this virus will \"tend\" toward improved transmission characteristics and depressed virulence. The speed is a bit surprising, but then it reminded me of that study I read on the one bird epidemic in the US and I was less so, yes, fully understanding the distinctions between humans and birds and different types of viruses...blah blah... You know while you are analyzing the bark on the tree in such detail, the world goes on and by the time you figure it out, it could be too late. I still have to wonder how many Epis would have acted when John Snow did or would they still be waiting for statistical significance and a better constructed study. \n\nWe still have so much to learn and different perspectives can inform others. So, more genomic understanding of bird viruses and a better epidemiologic understanding of of human pandemic organisms could actually result in a better response overall.

In the case of MYXV, this trade-off is thought to lead to \u2018intermediate\u2019 virulence grades being selectively advantageous: higher virulence may mean that the rabbit host dies before inter-host transmission, whereas lower virulence is selected against because it does not increase virus transmission rates. A similar trade-off model has been proposed to explain the evolution of HIV virulence40. However, many doubts have been raised about the general applicability of the trade-off model35,41,42,43, virus fitness will be affected by traits other than virulence and transmissibility39,41,44, contrary results have been observed in experimental studies45 and relatively little is known about evolutionary trade-offs in nature. For example, in the case of the second virus released as a biocontrol against European rabbits in Australia \u2014 rabbit haemorrhagic disease virus (RHDV) \u2014 there is evidence that virulence has increased through time, probably because virus transmission often occurs through blow flies that feed on animal carcasses, making host death selectively favourable46. Similarly, experimental studies of plant RNA viruses have shown that high virulence does not necessarily impede host adaptation47 and, in the case of malaria, higher virulence was shown to provide the Plasmodium parasites with a competitive advantage within hosts48.\n\nhttps://www.nature.com/articles/s41576-018-0055-5\n\nWe have plenty of evidence of virulence being selected for \n\nSince the beginning of the pandemic people have been predicting that SARS-CoV-2 would mutate and become milder.\n\nYou mentioned SARS and MERS, being an epidemiologist, you should know that neither passed asymptomatically and both had much lower R0.\n\nSARS presented with a fever for example.\n\nThe point being that Covid started more mild and could spread asymptomatically.  As much as the idea that a more mild strain would be selected for ix true, it requires the strain to at once transmit better and be more mild (when you have spread without symptoms, that space in the fitness landscape is much smaller)\n\n> AT that point the virus became very virulent just before essentially disappearing as distinct antagonistic organism to certain bird populations. I also look at things like CCR5 and can see how WE as a species have reacted to existential threats...\n\nDude, the ccr5 is an adaptation to either plague (consensus) or smallpox(I read a paper that argued that smallpox was more likely to have provided the selective pressure) either way, that demonstrates that we changed and not the pathogen.

This will lead to a tighter-than-it-should-be credible interval, but it's better than nothing, and may still show that it's still uncertain whether the \"true efficacy\" is above 90%.\n\nThe Pfizer/BioNTech analysis used:\n\n> A minimally informative beta prior, beta(0.700102, 1), is proposed for \u03b8 = (1-VE)/(2-VE). The prior is centered at \u03b8 = 0.4118 (VE=30%) which can be considered pessimistic. The prior allows considerable uncertainty; the 95% interval for \u03b8 is (0.005, 0.964) and the corresponding 95% interval for VE is (-26.2, 0.995).\n\nWe can get a rough estimate of the posterior just by using `beta (0.7+16, 1+(62*3))`, since there were 16 cases in the vaccine arm and 62 in the placebo (multiply by 3 to normalize). Just grab the theta values for the 2.5 and 97.5 percentiles and convert them to VE using the \u03b8 = (1-VE)/(2-VE) equation (solve for VE), and we get  ~85.9% to 95.9%.\n\nAgain, though, this is nothing more than a rough estimate.

Take a look at the chickenpox vaccine:\n\nhttps://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd-vac/varicella/hcp-effective-duration.htm\n\nWe see that a single dose is ~ 85% effective at preventing disease and almost 100% effective at preventing severe disease. These are very similar number to the mRNA COVID vaccines with wild type SARS 2 virus (pre Delta). What that means is that after 1 dose of the chickenpox vaccine, you still have 15% of people with breakthrough cases. But almost none of those cases become severe, so they don't require hospitalization or cause death. \n\nhttp://chickenpox.emedtv.com/m/chickenpox-vaccine/chickenpox-after-vaccine.html\n\nYou can literally replace the word \"chickenpox\" with \"COVID\" in the preceding paragraph and it is still correct. The reason nobody raises a big fuss about chickenpox breakthrough cases is because that disease is not nearly as serious as COVID. We've already got herd immunity for adults and routinely vaccinating children gets them to herd immunity too. So the disease itself isn't nearly as serious and we're at herd immunity, so a couple percent breakthrough cases is no big deal.\n\nWith the newer COVID variants like Delta, were seeing lower effectiveness of the vaccines. Where before they might've been ~90% effective at preventing disease, now they're ~60%. So most of the time these vaccines are indeed preventing the SARS 2 virus from replicating enough to give you COVID. Just like the chickenpox vaccine usually does. But because Delta replicates so much faster than wild type and has improved infection rates, it is unfortunately more likely now that vaccinated people will develop COVID symptoms before the body's immune response fights off the virus and you get a breakthrough case.

In addition, Delta variants caused a significantly higher rate of vaccine breakthrough cases (17.4% compared to 5.8% for all other variants). ***Importantly, only 8.4% of all COVID-19 cases occurred in fully vaccinated individuals, and relatively few of these patients required hospitalization.***\n\nSo, if you're arguing that vaccines don't reduce the rate of infection and spread (which is hard to ascertain when you won't answer simple and straightforward questions), you're certainly wrong about that.  \n\n> https://www.eurosurveillance.org/content/10.2807/1560-7917.ES.2021.26.30.2100636\n\nYour last study, also about Delta, while not explicitly saying that vaccines didn't help prevent the spread, did say...\n\n\"A recent study suggests reduced vaccine effectiveness of 36% against symptomatic disease caused by the Delta variant after one dose of Comirnaty vaccine [11], but excellent protection after full course; depending on disease severity, Comirnaty vaccine provides 88\u201392% protection against the Delta variant [11,12], and we saw similar rates among the fully vaccinated HCW in Ward 1.\"\n\nMake of that what you will.  \n\n> I've already stated this multiple times; both you and the other person challenging my position in this discussion have already agreed that Derek should have worded his claim like this. He didn't, however, and for some reason you want to continue arguing on his behalf even though you know he was wrong to assert we would have never had Delta if we'd been vaccinated enough.\n\nWe understood the intention of his statement.  Although clumsily stated, it's true that if we had better vaccines distributed earlier... we most likely would have had fewer variants manifest and, if we had the vaccines early enough combined with other basic steps broadly followed (social-distancing and mask wearing), we could have been over this pandemic by now.  \n\n> The most important purpose is the primary one and a subsequent purpose would a secondary one. The vaccines' primary purpose was to reduce disease severity. That was, in fact, what the trials measured. The hope was that they would also reduce transmission, which was not measured in the trials. Since transmission was not even measured during their trials, I can state with certainty that reduced transmission was not a primary function.\n\nPreviously, I would have asked for clarification here.  But, clearly, you want no part of that.  But I do believe that the studies done on the vaccine also included measuring the potential reduction in transmissibility of of the virus.  \n\n[The CDC, as of July 27th, says...](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/science/science-briefs/fully-vaccinated-people.html) \n\n>> A growing body of evidence indicates that people fully vaccinated with an mRNA vaccine (Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna) **are less likely than unvaccinated persons to acquire SARS-CoV-2 or to transmit it to others.** \n\n> It's hope, not science, that leads you to dig your heels in over this. \n\nThe CDC and many of the studies you've linked suggest that vaccination reduces the rate of transmission.  What do you think I'm digging my heels in over?  Oh, sorry, nevermind.  I forgot that you don't like to answer questions.  \n\n> Even when you admit elsewhere Derek's statement was indefensible you continue to argue on his behalf. Why? \n\nI did no such thing.  I said it was a clumsy statement and rephrased it to be more accurate.  You're interpretation of me \"admitting\" that it was \"indefensible\" is just you adding your personal perception to what was written.  But such statements that you make are not an accurate reflection of what was actually stated by others.  \n\nHave a nice day.", "sentiment": 0.971}, {"id": "hccp9ed", "author": "20hz", "parent_id": "hccnga9", "content": "I do not disagree with you for what it is worth.

As its name implies, it causes painful vesicles (blisters) on the mouth, anus, and udder of infected animals, although they usually recover completely.  When it infects humans, it doesn\u2019t replicate very well and usually causes mild flu-like symptoms for a day or two.  Virologically, it\u2019s interesting because it only has structural genes and no nonstructural genes (structural proteins are found in the virion, while nonstructural proteins are made by the virus inside the infected cell and are involved in replication but are not carried in the virion itself).  \n\nThe virus itself is enveloped with a single surface glycoprotein called G.  To make ERVEBO, G was replaced with the surface glycoprotein from Ebolavirus.  This further attenuates the VSV, but it means that the new VSV particle will be coated with the Ebolavirus surface glycoprotein, so even if the host has antibodies to VSV, they won\u2019t stop the new ERVEBO.  The virus binds to cells, starts to replicate (but isn\u2019t very good at it) and the patient develops immunity to the surface glycoprotein.\n\nSo this platform can be used with any enveloped virus that has a single surface glycoprotein (I\u2019m not sure if it would be possible to use it on something like a paramyxovirus, which has two major surface glycoproteins, H and F).  Well, coronaviruses have a single surface glycoprotein called S (spike).  So Merck is taking that spike gene and putting it where the G gene was and developing it into a virus.

Or do they have some type of data prior to advancing things and phase 3 is really a larger scale test of the effectiveness of the vaccine?

The person doesn't get sick. Does that mean your vaccine works? Maybe. Or maybe that person wouldn't have gotten sick for another reason. Or maybe the challenge wasn't like natural infection. Or other factors.\n\nSo even in a pretty controlled experiment you don't get answers in this kind of science without statistics. Once you have to use statistics you start asking and answering questions based on how likely or unlikely a result could be due to random chance. For a single person you learn pretty much nothing. \n\nThe phase 3 studies that have enrolled 30,000 people require about 150 people to get sick in the populations to have a reasonable certainty of answering the question of if the vaccine works or not. They have to just get sick by naturally going about their life. If statistically more get sick in the control group than the vaccine group the vaccine works with the ratio saying something about how well. If the same number get sick the vaccine doesn't work.\n\nWhat is known now are correlates of immunity. The vaccines are known to raise an immune response. That \\*suggests\\* they will work, but it doesn't prove that they do. Beyond efficacy you also have to look for rare side effects. If 1 person in 15,000 has a bad outcome you probably won't give a particular vaccine to a 20 year old but you might be willing to give it to a 70 year old, because the risk of death in the 70-80 age group might be 1 in 100 if they catch the disease but it is only 1 in 10,000 in the 20-30 age group say. (The actual numbers here are made up and just an example). Phase 3 studies are large enough to see effects comparable to the risk of the disease. So at least for short term complications we will know if the vaccine is less or more risk than the disease. If it is significantly less risk then it will be used if it isn't it will be thrown out. \n\nThe phase 3 study may show no safety issues but when they inject:\n\n150,000,000 people with it instead of\n\n15,000 you will probably see some events that are very rare.", "sentiment": 0.9585}, {"id": "g6d2arm", "author": "bluesam3", "parent_id": "g6cfc5r", "content": "The early trials give them some ideas: first, they do some stuff in a lab: they see if their vaccine is effective in tissue cultures.

However, only real world tests will show if the higher titre is really necessary for preventing death & hospitalization. The higher measured antibody titres do not always directly convert to real world protection.\n\nHowever, the higher antibody titres are desirable, if you want to increase your chances to reach high enough protection levels. The booster basically guaranteed that the trials would yield positive results (over 50% protection from symptomatic illness).\n\nSecond, three weeks is about the minimum you can do between prime & booster for the booster to work at all.  This minimum delay between shots shortened the phase 3 schedule so it was chosen. \n\nSo, the choices were made to ensure that there would be a vaccine quickly. They were the correct choices too as we can see. We now have vaccines.\n\nSo, one shot might offer high enough protection with Pfizer or Moderna too. The level of protection will most likely not drop after three weeks since it's not dropping with J&J or Az/Ox either from which there is data. The vaccines use a very similar approach after delivery, so it is likely that the immunization characteristics are more similar than different.\n\nThe question of sterilizing immunity (preventing even asymptomatic infection) is another one though.

If it detects viral RNA in the cytosol, it attaches to a receptor on the mitochondria, preventing the mitochondria from transcribing and replicating any more RNA.  This starts an Interferon 1 response.  INF1 is released outside the surface of the infected cell, some are re-bound to receptors on the cell that released it, some bind to neighboring cells, telling them to slow down any replication going on and to encapsulate anything attempting to come into the cells with special markers to destroy.  \n\n1) Some viruses dump their RNA directly into the cell once it makes contact.  Covid19 is double membraned once it enters the cell (think of a membrane around the entire virus, encapsulating the spikes as well), avoiding detection by roaming RIG-1/MDA5 until it splits open near the mitochondria in an effort to gain access to the replicating apparatus inside.  Since the dsRNA is only exposed for a brief period in the cytosol, detection is lowered.\n\n2) covid19 creates a protease that beats the RIG-1 to the mitochondrial receptor telling the RIG-1 \"everything is ok\" and sends the RIG-1 to go self terminate, allowing free replication.  Blocks the interferon 1 cascade.\n\n3) steals the RNA cap from the host cell RNA, essentially making itself recognized as a friend to the cell.\n\n4) MHC I/II - take viral peptides detected in cytosol up to the surface and hold them up like a hand holding an apple, signaling T-cells that \"I am infected with something, please terminate me\".  In contrast, an empty \"hand\" signals to the T-cell everything is fine.  Covid19 blocks MHC I/II from presenting the antigen.  T-cells eventually recognize that the cell doesnt have as many MHC I/II on the surface as it should have and terminates the cell.\n\n5) since covid19 is almost entirely made of ACE spikes, monocytes in the extracellular space dont recognize it as a threat since other reactions in the body use those same shaped proteins.  \n\nAll the retro viruses have complex innate immune system evasion techniques.

Because lovenox doesn't do swell with metal valves and he's at high risk, he's back on warfarin with a target INR between 3-3.5, plavix and aspirin. No DOACSs.

He listed the symptoms as fever, digestive problems and vascular inflammation.\n\nAt least three children in the US aged six months to eight years are being treated for a similar condition. Mark Gorelik, a specialist treating the patients at Columbia University Medical Center in New York, said all had fever and inflammation of the heart and gut. \u201cRight now, we\u2019re at the very beginning of trying to understand what that represents,\u201d he told Reuters. Gorelik believes the cases are not Kawasaki disease but a similar condition that shares a common cause, namely an infectious agent that triggers an immune response.The three New York cases follow a report from Stanford University in California, in which a 6-month-old was admitted to hospital with Kawasaki disease and was later diagnosed with coronavirus.\n\nMany of the children having treatment for the new syndrome have tested positive for coronavirus, but others have not. That could mean that the syndrome is not related to coronavirus, that the children had cleared the virus before they were tested, or that the test missed the infection.\n\nSome doctors suspect the syndrome is a \u201cpost-infection inflammatory response\u201d where the immune system overreacts in the wake of an infection. This would suggest that in some children the disease has two phases \u2013 the initial infection and a secondary immune response that takes hold later.\n\nDr Nazima Pathan, a consultant in paediatric intensive care in Cambridge, said the number of children admitted to intensive care units with Covid-19 was relatively low, but that some were presenting with what looked like toxic shock syndrome and Kawasaki disease. \u201cThese children have had a severe and prolonged inflammatory response to Covid-19 infection and they have not had severe lung disease, unlike the majority of cases in adults,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cWhilst this is an evolving situation, it is clear that these symptoms are reported in only handfuls of cases,\u201d Pathan added. \u201cThe important message is that if parents are worried about their children\u2019s health, they should seek medical advice.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe new syndrome, which has yet to be named, dominated discussion between leading doctors on a teleconference about Covid-19 in children hosted on Tuesday by the World [Health](https://www.theguardian.com/society/health) Organization.\n\nThe first known cases in Britain emerged three to four weeks ago, but doctors now plan to look over the medical records of children in intensive care earlier this year to check whether earlier cases were missed.\"", "sentiment": 0.9442}, {"id": "fp9ootb", "author": "Woodenswing69", "parent_id": "fp9o3cq", "content": "Hmm thanks.

As you get more clotting you increase the risk of clumps of platelets breaking off and floating in the blood stream, these will either be broken down by the body or can get stuck somewhere else.  If a few of these combined and get big enough that larger clump could get stuck somewhere important causing a stroke, heart attack etc  that kills you.  This would explain why we are seeing tons of \"mini-clot\" throughout the lungs, some of these break off and then its a bit of a luck game if your body breaks it down or if it grows and blocks something important. \n\n\nthe source that u/dadealeus provides argues something kinda similar.  He argues that as part of the immune response to COVID the body is releasing histamine.  Histamine is normal, but in allergies you have too much of it and that causes problems.  So as the pneumonia progresses you get histamine release and a lack of oxygen caused by the pnemonia (this isn't the histamine causing the lack of oxygen like it would in a severe peanut allergy).  He argues that these 2 factors cause a net over-release of a clotting factor (or technically, its corresponding anti-coagulant gets \"exhausted\" first, your body stops releasing is sooner than it release the clotting factor).  So you have an increase in the clotting factor in your blood, which causes platelets to start adhering to each other and that causes the clots we are seeing.  There's a few jumps in there that I had issues with but I don't know enough to just say no so I'm still looking through the literature a bit to see if all those make sense.\n\nThe problem I have with both of these is that anecdotally our measures of clotting seem to be higher in covid patients than other pneumonia patients.  So to me it feels like both of these explanations don't explain why COVID specifically is causing this (yes the youtube video makes the HP argument but doesn't explain why covid is unique).  Of course it could be we aren't used to seeing this many pneumonia patients and the prevalence isn't actually higher it just seems to be because there are so many more cases we are seeing.", "sentiment": -0.9695}, {"id": "fp9tj45", "author": "marsloversonearth", "parent_id": "fp9nkzg", "content": "Interesting!

There has been an outbreak of \"lycan disease\" and people are turning into hairy beasts full of rage. What's the first first thing that everyone reaches for? [Silver bullets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver_bullet) because although it's expensive and a very niche solution, it's is effective against werewolf like creatures. \n\nBut somewhere along the way, we make a discovery. From a few observations:\n\n* Jane and Thomas were walking back from the orchard and encountered a werewolf and somehow it didn't attack them. \n* Ol' Betty Sue was baking a pie and a werewolf that entered her house left without killing her.\n* Mysteriously, no teachers in the city have been killed.\n\nSo someone starts to wonder what these all have in common. And an insightful physician says, \"they were all eating apples!\". And so the villagers' physicians come up with a (horrific) test: Let's give the *some* of the orphans in Saint Anne's School apples with every meal and allow them to play outside; and let's give some of the orphans tarts instead. To be semi-random, orphans born in even years get apples and the ones born in odd years get tarts. No trading allowed!\n\nSo the study began, but while it was ongoing, the smith and the jeweler kept on supplying silver bullets to the villagers!\n\nWell, after four weeks, the physicians check the experiment's progress. They discover that zero orphans in the apple eating group were killed, and only one was maimed though not turned. And 8 in the tart eating group were killed and another 5 were infected with lycan disease. \n\nThe hypothesis has been validated: An apple a day keeps the werewolves away!\n\nOf course, there are a few cynical and conspiratorial villagers in the bunch. They ask aloud, \"Why were *silver bullets* pushed back in the beginning!? Everyone knows *an apple a day* is the answer!\" Others among them suggest that it's the village jeweler and smith conspiring to profiteer off of the outbreak of lycan disease. It seems so obvious...\n\nBut again, turning to the record, we are reminded that no one knew that eating apples prevented one from being attacked by werewolves. They're conflating the adage of \"an apple a day keeps the doctor away\" and the general idea that apples are good and healthy with the specific fact established by recent observations and experiments that apples have a specific effect in preventing lycan disease.\n\nBut because everyone's under a lot of stress with the whole werewolf thing, and people are looking for targets to blame... it's somehow easier to believe that the jeweler and the smith, who really were just trying to help, somehow were suppressing a better alternative. But the truth is that the villagers had no alternative! And even long after the apple news was discovered, the town still needed to keep a stock of silver bullets because they were effective!\n\n***", "sentiment": -0.3987}, {"id": "ge54kze", "author": "darknessdown", "parent_id": "ge51kh2", "content": "Woah that was simultaneously really impressive and more than a little off putting", "sentiment": 0.5563}, {"id": "ge52cqx", "author": "MurphysLab", "parent_id": "ge51kh2", "content": "## Back to COVID Science\n\nSo, let's get back to COVID-19 now. At the beginning of the pandemic, no one had any clue that vitamin D was playing such a big role in modulating the effects of the disease on individuals. \n\nWhen you are faced with some new, partially unknown problem, you start with solutions to similar problems. In this case, we know that COVID-19 is a (corona)virus, so for *severe* cases, you treat them with a [**broad-spectrum antiviral drug**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broad-spectrum_antiviral_drug):\n\n> Broad-spectrum antiviral drugs (or broad-spectrum antiviral agents, BSAA) are a class of antiviral drugs, which target and inhibit the replication and development of a broad range of viral pathogens. BSAAs work by inhibiting viral proteins (such as polymerases, proteases, or reverse transcriptases) or by targeting host cell proteins and processes exploited by the virus during infection.\n\n> Many BSAs are found showing efficacy against a given virus outside their original indication, showing antiviral activity against other viruses than originally investigated (such as remdesivir and ritonavir/lopinavir) or outside their original therapeutic indications [...]. This makes BSAs potential candidates for drug repurposing. Repurposing of BSAs will allow for quicker, cheaper and more efficient development of antivirals than de novo drug development.\n\nAnti-viral drugs are targeted at viruses, much as silver bullets are targeted for werewolves. The problem here is that with COVID-19, lots of these broad-spectrum anti-viral drugs weren't working effectively. And that was despite through repeated, *desperate* trying!  Here's an early review from May that looked at a bunch of them:\n\n> Evolving research and clinical data regarding the virologic SARS-CoV-2 suggest a potential list of repurposed drugs with appropriate pharmacological effects and therapeutic efficacies in treating COVID-19 patients. In this review, we will update and summarize the most common and plausible drugs for the treatment of COVID-19 patients. These drugs and therapeutic agents include antiviral agents (remdesivir, hydroxychloroquine, chloroquine, lopinavir, umifenovir, favipiravir, and oseltamivir), and supporting agents (Ascorbic acid, Azithromycin, Corticosteroids, Nitric oxide, IL-6 antagonists), among others. We hope that this review will provide useful and most updated therapeutic drugs to prevent, control, and treat COVID-19 patients until the approval of vaccines and specific drugs targeting SARS-CoV-2.\n\n> An Update on Current Therapeutic Drugs Treating COVID-19, Curr Pharmacol Rep. 2020 May 11 : 1\u201315.\n\n> https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7211915/\n\nRead through that review! At that point, it seemed that the only one that was reported to be effective was  [Remdesivir](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remdesivir). Moreover, subsequent research has *partially* upheld that early finding:\n\n\n> BACKGROUND\n\n> Although several therapeutic agents have been evaluated for the treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19), no antiviral agents have yet been shown to be efficacious.\n\n> CONCLUSIONS\n\n> Our data show that remdesivir was superior to placebo in shortening the time to recovery in adults who were hospitalized with Covid-19 and had evidence of lower respiratory tract infection. \n\n> \"Remdesivir for the Treatment of Covid-19 \u2014 Final Report\", The New England Journal of Medicine, November 5, 2020\n\n> https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2007764\n\nBut that's why remdesivir became the drug of choice. Not because of its price, but because it had early evidence of efficacy when many other treatments did not.\n\n***\n\n**Edit:** I should make clear that remdesivir is no longer the drug of choice, per the World Health Organization, as larger studies have shown a relatively weak effect, if any. The WHO's recommendation was updated recently in light of those studies, in favour of corticosteroid treatments:\n\n\n> **Recommendations:** The panel made a conditional recommendation against the use of remdesivir in hospitalized\npatients with COVID-19, regardless of disease severity. This guidance adds to recommendations published in the\nprevious version: a strong recommendation for systemic corticosteroids in patients with severe and critical COVID19, and a conditional recommendation against systemic corticosteroids in patients with non-severe COVID-19.\n\n> https://apps.who.int/iris/handle/10665/336729 ([PDF](https://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/336729/WHO-2019-nCov-remdesivir-2020.1-eng.pdf))", "sentiment": 0.8088}, {"id": "ge52yq1", "author": "MurphysLab", "parent_id": "ge52cqx", "content": "## What About Vitamin D?\n\nBut along the way as our physicians and scientists are battling this virus, people start looking for trends. And one of those trends was how vitamin D was a big issue. \n\nPerhaps one of the first hints of this issue was the disproportionate effect COVID-19 was having on Black Americans:\n\n\n> In the USA, early data suggest that African Americans are disproportionately affected by COVID-19. In a preliminary study of data compiled from hospitals in 14 US states, African Americans represented 33% of COVID-19 hospitalisations, despite only making up 18% of the total population studied. In another analysis, among COVID-19 deaths for which race and ethnicity data were available, death rates from COVID-19 in New York City (NY, USA) among black or African American people (92\u00b73 deaths per 100 000 population) and Hispanic or Latino people (74\u00b73) were substantially higher than that of white (45\u00b72) or Asian (34\u00b75) people. \u201cStudies are underway to confirm these data and understand and potentially reduce the impact of COVID-19 on the health of racial and ethnic minorities\u201d, a spokesperson from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) confirmed to The Lancet Respiratory Medicine.\n\n> \"Evidence mounts on the disproportionate effect of COVID-19 on ethnic minorities\", *The Lancet Respiratory Medicine*, Published:May 08, 2020\n\n> https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanres/article/PIIS2213-2600(20)30228-9/fulltext \n\nSome of this is certainly a result of socioeconomic disparity, but part of the problem is now understood to involve the inherently lower levels of vitamin D present in individuals with dark skin. (cf. \"[Vitamin D deficiency in African Americans is associated with a high risk of severe disease and mortality by SARS-CoV-2](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41371-020-00398-z)\", Journal of Human Hypertension).\n\nBut that was one of many hints of a trend which pointed physicians to say, \"Hey, we really should study the effect of vitamin D levels on this disease\":\n\n> It is posited by contributors [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] to BMJ, \u2018Preventing a covid-19 pandemic\u2019, others, [6, 7, 8] and myself, [9] that vitamin D, and particularly vitamin D deficiency, is a likely factor in the progression, and/ or severity, and/ or mortality of COVID-19; and also may present clinical treatment opportunities.\n\n> My preprint, \u2018Vitamin D deficiency: a factor in COVID-19, progression, severity and mortality? \u2013 An urgent call for research\u2019, [9] posits, greater vitamin D deficiency <25nmol/L in southern (E.g. Spain and Italy), than northern European Countries (E.g. Germany, Norway, Finland, Iceland), may help account for differentials, in mortality rates per million. Consistent with this, Northern Europeans have higher vitamin D food intakes, food fortification, and supplement more. This is an easily testable posit.\n\n> [...]\n\n> Robert A Brown\n\n> 07 April 2020\n\n> https://www.bmj.com/content/368/bmj.m810/rr-46\n\nSo early on physicians and scientists were seeing hints that vitamin D might be involved, but until the studies *confirmed* that, no one knew. Sure, now it feels like \"Well, everyone knows that vitamin D is good for you... they should have tried it\", but the randomness of those who experienced severe symptoms didn't directly communicate that. And there are thousands of possible factors: To check all of them systematically takes ages. We didn't have ages -- we had people dying. \n\nPlus, you can't just throw the everything and the kitchen sink at the patient while at the same time **learning** something. It's why if you're designing an experiment, you're only allowed to change **one variable** at a time. And with squishy biological systems, outcomes aren't as clear cut, so you need lots of patients (but it's a deadly disease, so you can't intentionally make more atients)... so you can only try a few things at once. Where do you put your money? Where it's most likely to win the bet. In science, that involves having a logical nexus to the problem. i.e. Have virus ---> use an antiviral. You can't go trying lavender oil, *because peoples' lives are at risk!*\n\nAnd yes, even [vitamin C was tested](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7211915/) because the researchers had a reason to suspect it might help:\n\n> [...] ***Given this background,*** a phase II clinical trial (NCT04264533) is initiated in China to evaluate high-dose IV vitamin C in ICU patients with severe COVID-19-associated pneumonia [80]. Some hospitals have reported giving infected patients 1500 mg of vitamin C as supportive treatment. High-dose IV vitamin C has been given in the treatment of 50 moderate to severe COVID-19 patients in China [81]. The doses varied between 2 and 10 g per day, given over a period of 8-\u201310-h IV infusion. [...]\n\nBut as science usually goes, there's a bit of serendipity. Someone, perhaps by chance, notices a pattern and looks further. And from that investigation we can discover a mechanism understand not only what works, but why it works. That helped those on the forefront of science to see that vitamin D played a role. And it wasn't until that connection was made that people knew to act. \n\n***\n\nSo that's the end of my (I hope) informative little rant. It isn't some kind of \"big pharma\" conspiracy. It's science and medicine and pharmacology throwing everything that we have at a novel disease... and then, by luck, find something cheap and effective that happens to reduce the severity of the disease.", "sentiment": 0.9928}, {"id": "ge7d3ij", "author": "Z7N6Qo", "parent_id": "ge52yq1", "content": "This is why I visit this sub..

For opinions we should defer to public health agencies (FDA, CDC, BCCDC, Health Canada, etc...), the WHO, and your physician. But when I want to *become (vaguely) informed* about a technical topic I generally follow the same procedure.\n\n**A word of caution:** Note that this is about becoming *vaguely* informed. Becoming truly informed or expert is not possible for most of us, given the huge backlog of information that one needs to understand. All of us lack the time, if not the ability. And while you might be able to develop a good understanding of the efficacy of a drug, there's so many connections and contradictions and other factors that you are going to miss. That's why even if we have physicians, we have specialties within medicine: oncology for cancer; surgeons for surgery; dermatologists for skin; etc... Deep expertise takes a long time to develop and that is needed as a foundation for being fully informed. \n\nSo this is a guide to becoming *vaguely* informed. \n\n## **Step 1.** Visit Wikipedia\n\nWikipedia usually provides a basic and usually unbiased summary of a topic. I am not turning to Wikipedia to form an opinion, rather just to get a snapshot showing [*the lay of the land*](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/the%20lay%20of%20the%20land). \n\nOne of the biggest challenges for someone who is approaching a new zone of knowledge is vocabulary. We use words to encapsulate ideas, but if you know the idea and not the word, you are generally powerless to learn more. Knowing the right words is like having a key opening the door to more knowledge. So reading a brief Wikipedia article, and perhaps following a few of the links within, will familiarize you with that new vocabulary. \n\nAdditionally, within Wikipedia we find sources - links to primary articles. So it can be good to follow these to examine what the original article actually says. One can provide a link to a source, which gives information a *superficial appearance of support*, but it's necessary to confirm that the source agrees with what it is used to support.\n\n## **Step 2.** Visit Google Scholar\n\nThe link: https://scholar.google.com/\n\nWe want to know about Ivermectin and COVID-19, so we can search that:\n\nOur search: https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=Ivermectin+and+COVID-19\n\nNow, because this is a rapidly evolving area of science and medicine, one needs to be cautious and pay attention to the context of each article. \n\n* Is the article published in a peer-reviewed journal? Be very cautious about non-peer-reviewed publications:\n  * News stories\n  * Press releases\n  * Preprints\n* Where is the article published? \n  * Is it a reputable journal? \n  * Does it have an Impact Factor? \n  * If you aren't sure, try sticking with PubMed - https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=covid-19\n* Who published the article? If it's by professors, they usually have a profile on a university web page. But physicians often don't. \n* Is there a known conflict of interest?\n* What kind of article is this? **Reviews and meta-analysis papers are often the best to go to if you are not an expert!** However they come at a later stage in the overall progress of scientific research. \n  * Study\n  * Meta-Analysis\n  * Review\n  * Letters & Commentary\n* Was the study registered in advance? There should be a statement pointing to clinicaltrials.gov or a similar agency.\n* How is the drug being used? (e.g. prophylaxis / preventative, or treatment of those infected, or for those with severe disease)\n* How large was the study? Bigger studies are less likely to be skewed by random effects. (see: [funnel plots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Funnel_plot))\n* When was the article published? Early articles tend to be more speculative, so again more caution. \n* Look at what's most cited. Again, earlier ones will be cited more often, but given to papers published in the same timeframe, generally more *compelling* ones are cited more frequently. Google Scholar shows rough citation counts, so this can help you to see what has generated the most discussion. Beware of early stuff! \n\nAlso, note that you can click on those citation numbers and get a list of articles cite that paper. This can be very useful to check to see if some promising early result was later confirmed to be effective. \n\nBut it isn't enough to look at just those factors... you have to read the papers.\n\n## **Step 3.** Organize a List of Articles!\n\nOrganize your literature survey. Since this is an area that's happened essentially all within 1 year, a chronological ordering will probably be best, since it allows us to see the genesis of the idea and how perspectives have evolved among experts.\n\n## **Step 4.** Read Several Papers\n\nIdeally, you read several papers, in full. And from those, you can come up with a list of which other papers you should read, because now you have the context of citations. \n\nBut chances are high that you don't have a ton of time. So you skim the papers' content. (Remember: you've already looked at the previously described factors)\n\nSkimming:\n\n1. Read the title. What is the focus?\n2. Read the abstract. For medical papers, these are often well laid out with separate sections, mirroring the full paper, e.g.:\n  * Background\n  * Methods\n  * Results\n  * Conclusions\n3. Skim the paper\n   * Read the conclusions\n   * Then read the results\n   * Look at the data\n4. If you feel it's a worthwhile paper, read it in full, start to end. \n\n***\n\n## **What would I read on this topic?**\n\nHere's a brief (quick and dirty) outline with some of the main papers that I've found, in chronological order (by date of first publication in journals):\n\n* 2020 Apr 3 : \"The FDA-approved drug ivermectin inhibits the replication of SARS-CoV-2 in vitro\" : https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32251768/\n  * Note that this title is a bit misleading.

I've done a lot of Steps 1, 3 and 4 over the past 9 months for multiple drugs, but not in an organised manner.

The question that bothers me is the absence of a large proper RCT in a western country, especially given that ivermectin is not prescribed wholesale to the public like it is in South America and South Asia. Meanwhile, there are very detailed illustrative videos about the mechanism of ivermectin reducing the replication of the virus and helping fight the inflammation response too. Not that I understand much, just that one particular part of the ivermectin molecule blocks the cell mechanism of virus replication once the virus has entered the cell.\n\nGiven all this, I find the lack of interest in conducting a large-scale RCT in western countries surprising. We already have the vaccines by now, so maybe it's not commerically feasible or medically that exciting to do an ivermectin RCT, but given the longevity of the pandemic, it is worth every bit for someone to do a 500+ sized RCT with ivermectin as prophylaxis and mild-stage outpatient intervention at least. If not in the ICU (where observational studies and reports have also shown benefits).\n\nAgain, thank you very much for taking the time to explain all that.

With a covariate-adjusted relative risk of death of 11.3, mortality was much higher among vitamin D insufficient patients than among other patients. When translated to the proportion of deaths in the population that is statistically attributable to vitamin D insufficiency (\u201cpopulation attributable risk proportion\u201d), a key measure of public health relevance of risk factors [[2](https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/12/12/3642/htm#B2-nutrients-12-03642)], these results imply that 87% of COVID-19 deaths may be statistically attributed to vitamin D insufficiency and could potentially be avoided by eliminating vitamin D insufficiency.\n> \n> Although results of an observational study, such as this one, need to be interpreted with caution, as done by the authors [[1](https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/12/12/3642/htm#B1-nutrients-12-03642)], due to the potential of residual confounding or reverse causality (i.e., vitamin D insufficiency resulting from poor health status at baseline rather than vice versa), it appears extremely unlikely that such a strong association in this prospective cohort study could be explained this way, in particular as the authors had adjusted for age, sex and comorbidity as potential confounders in their multivariate analysis. There are also multiple plausible mechanisms that may well explain the observed associations, such as increased concentrations of pro-inflammatory cytokines, as well as decreased concentrations of anti-inflammatory cytokines in vitamin D insufficiency [[3](https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/12/12/3642/htm#B3-nutrients-12-03642),[4](https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/12/12/3642/htm#B4-nutrients-12-03642)]. Although final proof of causality and prevention of deaths by vitamin D supplementation would have to come from randomized trials which meanwhile have been initiated (e.g., [[5](https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/12/12/3642/htm#B5-nutrients-12-03642)]), the results of such trials will not be available in the short run. Given the dynamics of the COVID-19 pandemic and the proven safety of vitamin D supplementation, it therefore appears highly debatable and potentially even unethical to await results of such trials before public health action is taken. Besides other population-wide measures of prevention, widespread vitamin D3 supplementation at least for high-risk groups, such as older adults or people with relevant comorbidity, which has been proven by randomized controlled trials to be beneficial with respect to prevention of other acute respiratory infections and acute acerbation of asthma and chronic pulmonary disease [[6](https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/12/12/3642/htm#B6-nutrients-12-03642),[7](https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/12/12/3642/htm#B7-nutrients-12-03642),[8](https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/12/12/3642/htm#B8-nutrients-12-03642),[9](https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/12/12/3642/htm#B9-nutrients-12-03642),[10](https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/12/12/3642/htm#B10-nutrients-12-03642)], should be promoted.

Nobody has ever demonstrated a verifiable reason for the seasonality of respiratory infections.   If low humidity and a high propensity for staying indoors were causatory, we'd expect to see influenza outbreaks through most of the Southwest USA and Australia in the summer (and we don't).  Additionally, we frequently see outbreaks in places that have high humidity in the winter months.  Vitamin D very well could constitute the main reason for the seasonality, but we just don't have enough data one way or the other.\n\nThere's a lot of historical evidence that Vitamin-D is far more important to the survival of populations than simply its ability to prevent rickets.  You're talking about something that's vital enough to population survival that it essentially drives the existence of multiple races.  Similarly, there's ample anthropological evidence that supplementation with Vitamin D corresponds very directly to high population level fitness and survival in northern climates.

With SARS-1, they made heavy use of corticosteroids to suppress the cytokine storm, but later reviews revealed that this almost certainly didn't help, and most likely made it much worse (increased mortality). This may be the case here as well, and a lot of folks are strongly cautioning against the use of heavy-handed immunosuppressants like glucocorticoids. This doesn't mean *all* immunosuppresion is out -- it's possible that more targeted things could help, and that could be why hydroxychloroquine helps. But there's also evidence that chloroquines have more direct action in attacking the virus's infection process directly, and that could be what makes them useful here as opposed to the immune effects.\n\nHere's my intuition regarding the immune system and viral progression (take it with a grain of salt; I am not actually an expert):\n\n1. During incubation, the virus spreads, trying to set up itself up in as many cells as possible. Coronaviruses are a type of RNA virus that largely replicates in the cytoplasm, taking over the endoplasmic reticulum and ribosomes to create its own replication factories. Because of the time this takes, viral load during early stages is quite low.\n2. Ideally, as early as possible, the virus gets spotted and antigen presentation occurs, with T-cells being rapidly specialized to fight the new invader.\n3. The cytotoxic T-cells (CD8+) go around apoptosis-ing every cell that looks like it has viral infection. This basically starves out the virus. Antibodies are probably not a big factor here, because the viral load is just far, far too high to possibly neutralize it with antibodies alone.\n\nBut what happens if step 2/3 happens too late? At this point, there may be so many infected cells, and such a catastrophically high viral load that attempting to neutralize the virus *implies a cytokine storm*. And CD8+ cells just go around killing everything (because everything is infected). So at this point, if you try to stop the cytokine storm, you're stopping the symptoms and not the cause. This matches the reports of seriously ill patients having obscenely high viral loads, as well as the fact that a longer incubation period seems to be highly correlated with severe illness.\n\nIt should be noted that if this is a remotely accurate view of the process, immunosuppression may only be a large problem if it suppresses this pathway. There's all kinds of different immunosuppressants -- for example, many MS drugs attack CD20 receptors on B-cells (IIRC), which are responsible for antibody synthesis. That might not actually cause a problem here, but don't take my word for that.\n\nProbably not coincidentally, the function of the adaptive immune system and T-cell maturation process (via the thymus) is vastly decreased in older folks (see \"thymic involution\").\n\nThere's a huge number of more narrow-spectrum immunomodulators that might be worth looking at, though it would be terribly speculative at this point and not a clinical recommendation, especially because it's not actually obvious which things you want to suppress vs which things you want to enhance. Off the top of my head, this includes:\n\n* 5-HT2 antagonists/agonists. 5-HT2 is an important immunomodulatory receptor, and both 2A and 2B are involved in the immune response. Examples: [https://www.pnas.org/content/103/46/17420.short?rss=1](https://www.pnas.org/content/103/46/17420.short?rss=1) [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21240377](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21240377). i haven't seen this tried, but i suspect it's too speculative to even be experimented with in vivo, since the 5-HT/immune system interaction is not well mapped.\n* things that narrowly attack specific immune pathways, like TNF alpha, IL-6, etc. unfortunately, most of these drugs tend to be very expensive and in limited supply (usually biologics like monoclonal antibodies), so might not actually be practical to use in a pandemic. i remember seeing news about sarilumab being tested for this..\n* there have been some experiments with narrower use of glucocorticoids (e.g. inhaled, much lower doses, or only at specific points in disease progression), with the intent to avoid the problem encountered with SARS-1. i haven't seen any studies with enough statistical power to conclude if any of these are helpful, though.\n\nplease correct me if any of this is clearly wrong or omitting something important.", "sentiment": -0.9671}, {"id": "fkl4ovb", "author": "edit8com", "parent_id": "fkl1j6o", "content": "great reply.", "sentiment": 0.6249}, {"id": "fklk8h2", "author": "leafleap", "parent_id": "fkl1j6o", "content": "Tocilizumab has been discussed for its use as an IL-6 inhibitor, pretty sure they used it in China at some point during the adventure.", "sentiment": 0.7579}, {"id": "fkl8kq0", "author": "Fussel2107", "parent_id": "fkl1j6o", "content": "I've also heard of Baricitinib being tested, though I specifically remember when I was taking Olumiant, my leukocytes dropped to 11%.

The first wave had resembled typical flu epidemics; those most at risk were the sick and elderly, while younger, healthier people recovered easily. By August, when the second wave began in France, Sierra Leone, and the United States,[[92]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_flu#cite_note-92)\u00a0the virus had mutated to a much deadlier form.

Low blood oxygen level leads to death, so ventilate. It was part of a series of assumptions that were made at the onset of the virus when either we didn\u2019t know, or we could improve the things that we didn\u2019t know, so we fell back on the default. For example we simply assumed airborne transmission was not happening because at the time we couldn\u2019t prove  it. We also assumed that people were getting infected mostly from contact surfaces, so we put a huge emphasis on disinfecting surfaces and washing hands, but now we know that it\u2019s not really a significant factor. Unfortunately it did more harm than good with the false sense of safety it created. \n\nThe thing about the acute respiratory syndrome is that it\u2019s not necessarily a lack of oxygen in the lungs. So aggressive ventilation may in some cases be necessary, and other cases is not any better than simply providing pure O2. The patient\u2019s  immune system overreacts to the presence of an \u201calien\u201c virus, one that no human body has ever experienced before 2019. Since none of our ancestors has ever been exposed to this virus, we like the adaptations necessary to mediate this immune response naturally. \n\nIn this particular virus, it has a high tendency to affect pulmonary tissue, causing a large amount of cytokines directing the immune response to the lungs, leading to the cytokine storm that damages and scars the interior lung tissue. And so in effect we are clogging up the conduit for oxygen to pass through the lungs into the blood. This leads to the drop in blood O2 level, which leads to clinicians applying the standard protocol which is aggressive ventilation. And frankly, there are no better options at this stage so one could argue that even if it won\u2019t help it\u2019s still the most compassionate protocol. \n\nThink of it like a giant bucket full of water, and the pipe leading to someone who is dying of thirst. But the pipe is getting clogged up, so the person can\u2019t drink any water. And you can\u2019t do anything about the clogged pipe, so you simply keep putting more and more water into the bucket but it\u2019s not doing any good. The flow through the pipe is simply too low to keep the person alive. Unfortunately, we don\u2019t have any method to \u201cunclog\u201d the pipe because you can\u2019t exactly go around giving millions of people lung transplants. And even if we could somehow try, a procedure like that in the circumstance would be almost certainly fatal. \n\nIf we look at it from a public health standpoint, I don\u2019t know just how many lives the ventilators actually saved. I don\u2019t think anyone\u2019s willing to do a study where they withhold ventilators from a control group of people with ARS.\n\nOxygen is possibly similar to a lesser extent. The prognosis is pretty poor once somebody has that much long tissue that it\u2019s affecting their blood O2 levels. Giving them pure O2 instead of air can certainly help but at the end of the day the oxygen simply can\u2019t permeate into the blood. Direct transfusion of oxygenated blood did not seem to have much success either though I don\u2019t know the full trial history with it. \n\nWhat we have now that we didn\u2019t have during the Spanish flu epidemic is immunosuppressive therapy. And that\u2019s the thing, the Spanish flu was very very similar in that it caused acute respiratory syndrome through an immune overreaction. For reasons we still don\u2019t fully understand, the Spanish flu affected healthy young adults in the prime of their life more severely and left older people with weaker immune systems largely alone, but Covid was the opposite. Until SARS this was thought to be the default for zoonotic viruses that kill through immune overreaction.\n\nI don\u2019t know why they\u2019ve been so incredibly slow to authorize experimental treatments of giving immunosuppressive therapy early on. I get it, it\u2019s not the safest thing in the world because we all need our immune system survive. And the dogma is that it\u2019s better to let 10,000 patients die than to kill one who would\u2019ve lived. But then we hear about President T and all of these other high-ranking officials being put on immunosuppressive therapy and isolation the moment they tested positive, while millions around the world were dying. And then only something like 2% of patients experience ARS so do we put 50 times that many people at risk by suppressing their immune system\u2018s?", "sentiment": -0.9385}, {"id": "htets7g", "author": "heretoreadreddid", "parent_id": "hte8zpc", "content": "Tell us you aren\u2019t a CCRN APN PA DO or MD without actually telling us.\n\nDroning on and on isn\u2019t going to convince anyone you are. \n\nARS isn\u2019t a thing.

So we dont know what sort of effect any of this would have now vs then, or vice versa. I only mentioned h1n1 in 2009 and now because the knowledge and tech have been similar. Not the same, but enough to draw a comparison to cfr to then and now. If the cfr for h1n1 is lower in 2009, which it seems to be by a wide margin, then you could suggest that covid in 1918 would be pretty devastating. To what degree, who knows.

On day 5, the high-dose arm of the study had to be interrupted due to the death of 11 patients, against four in the low-dose group. \u201cThis was a phase 2 study to evaluate safety and we used a high dose of chloroquine that has been used before\u201d said Lacerda. This same high dose was previously used to treat oncological patients for periods much longer than 10 days; it was also used in China with COVID-19 patients.However, the unfavorable outcome of the study provoked the animosity of those who support using chloroquine to treat COVID-19, first in the USA, and then in Brazil. Micheal Coudrey, an American political activist with 256\u2008700 Twitter followers referred to the study as \u201ca left-wing funded study that intentionally administered extremely high doses and used a less-safe version of the drug hydroxychloroquine, then used this as a pretense to indicate that chloroquine was ineffective and dangerous\u201d. Soon after, Brazilian president's son Eduardo Bolsonaro (who has 2 million Twitter followers) called it \u201ca fake study aimed at demonizing the drug\u201d.In another inflamed tweet, Eduardo Bolsonaro claimed that the study's authors were affiliated to the party funded by former Brazilian President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva and asked for an investigation. Soon after, Lacerda started to receive death threats through social media and had to request police protection, which was kept for more than 2 weeks. \u201cWhen the paper was published in *JAMA*, the threats stopped\u201d revealed Lacerda, indicating that publishing the study in a peer-reviewed high-impact journal may have shielded the researcher and his family.Besides suffering the death threats, the authors of the study may soon need to respond a legal action taken by three public prosecutors. With 32 points that the authors should justify, the legal action mainly challenges the high dose used in the trial, the choice for chloroquine instead of hydroxychloroquine, and the patient population. \u201cWhen we first announced we were going to test chloroquine to treat COVID-19 we were seen as heroes in Brazil, people sent us encouraging messages and everyone was excited. However, when the study's results came out, the attitude changed\u201d, says Lacerda, still in disbelief.Besides politicians and activists, the study has also been strongly condemned by some doctors and scientists, who cite observational and retrospective studies with lower level of evidence, and anecdotal accounts, to support treating COVID-19 with chloroquine, a drug traditionally used to treat malaria and having potential adverse effects, in particular relative to cardiovascular function. \u201cThese studies lack controls, so as in the case of anything done without proper control \u2026 you can see anything you want\u201d, believes Nikolaos Vasilakis, vice chair of research at the Center for Biodefense and Emerging Infectious Diseases and Center for Tropical Diseases at Institute for Human Infections and Immunity at University of Texas in Galveston, United States.For Mauro Schechter, a specialist in infectious disease and epidemiology and a professor in Brazil and in the USA at the University of Pittsburgh, and the Bloomberg School of Hygiene and Public Health at Johns Hopkins University, \u201cthe main problem is that doctors have no idea how a clinical trial works or what it takes to stablish that a drug is effective\u201d. Schechter, who is recovering himself from COVID-19, says that he was offered hydroxychloroquine when hospitalised but refused it \u201cin respect to science\u201d.Whether or not to adopt hydroxychloroquine to treat COVID-19 has turned into a political dispute that seems to benefit no one. \u201cWe may pass through this pandemic without knowing if this drug works or not\u201d, regrets Lacerda. In a letter issued by the Brazilian Society of Virology repudiating the threats received by Lacerda's research group, the society warns: \u201cOnly good science can save us in this pandemic of the new coronavirus; thus we supplicate, leave scientists alone to do their work!\u201d", "sentiment": -0.8961}, {"id": "fs7a1bf", "author": "DNAhelicase", "parent_id": "gspwfg", "content": "Locked because of too much politics.", "sentiment": 0.0}, {"id": "fs6zule", "author": "_holograph1c_", "parent_id": "fs6w3jp", "content": "There is a lot of evidence that points the fact that HCQ works if used early, quote from the [BBC article](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-52831017):\n\n>Chief doctor Nurettin Yiyit - whose art work is on the hospital walls  - says it's key to use hydroxychloroquine early. \"Other countries are  using this drug too late,\" he says, \"especially the United States.

Evaluating unexplained increases in deaths due to all causes or attributed to nonspecific outcomes, such as pneumonia and influenza, can provide a more complete picture of the burden of COVID-19.\n\n\nObjective\n\nTo estimate the burden of all deaths related to COVID-19 in the United States from March to May 2020.\n\n\nDesign, Setting, and Population\n\nThis observational study evaluated the numbers of US deaths from any cause and deaths from pneumonia, influenza, and/or COVID-19 from March 1 through May 30, 2020, using public data of the entire US population from the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS). These numbers were compared with those from the same period of previous years. All data analyzed were accessed on June 12, 2020.\n\n\nMain Outcomes and Measures\n\nIncreases in weekly deaths due to any cause or deaths due to pneumonia/influenza/COVID-19 above a baseline, which was adjusted for time of year, influenza activity, and reporting delays. These estimates were compared with reported deaths attributed to COVID-19 and with testing data.\n\n\nResults\u00a0\n\nThere were approximately 781\u202f000 total deaths in the United States from March 1 to May 30, 2020, representing 122\u202f300 (95% prediction interval, 116\u202f800-127\u202f000) more deaths than would typically be expected at that time of year. There were 95\u202f235 reported deaths officially attributed to COVID-19 from March 1 to May 30, 2020. The number of excess all-cause deaths was 28% higher than the official tally of COVID-19\u2013reported deaths during that period. In several states, these deaths occurred before increases in the availability of COVID-19 diagnostic tests and were not counted in official COVID-19 death records. There was substantial variability between states in the difference between official COVID-19 deaths and the estimated burden of excess deaths.\n\n\nConclusions and Relevance\u00a0\u00a0\n\nExcess deaths provide an estimate of the full COVID-19 burden and indicate that official tallies likely undercount deaths due to the virus.

The cat may have a genetic \"flaw\" that facilitates these mutations, or there may be a more \"virulent\" variant of this virus... research is still ongoing.", "sentiment": -0.7469}, {"id": "hc49v8r", "author": "SomeGalFromTexas", "parent_id": "hc07q14", "content": "What's interesting is that Feline Infectious Peritonitis (FIP) in cats is caused by the FCoV (feline coronavirus). This virus is pretty much endemic, and most cats are first exposed to it as young kittens. Normally, this virus causes relatively mild and short-lived enteric disease in cats. However, in some cats,  one hypothesis suggests that the virus undergoes a mutation within certain susceptible cats which \"converts\" the virus from a relatively minor-illness causing organism, to one that becomes lethal. There are breed correlations with the susceptibility to FIP, meaning that some breeds are more susceptible to developing FIV from exposure and infection with FCoV.\n\nFIP is a sporadic disease thought to be caused by viral variants that develop within each specific cat. The pathogenesis of FIP is unclear, but there are two main hypotheses. The \u201cinternal mutation theory\u201d states that cats are infected with the primarily avirulent FCoV that replicates in enterocytes; in some cats, a mutation occurs in a certain region of the FCoV genome that creates a new phenotype with the ability to replicate within macrophages. The presence of highly virulent strains of FCoV capable of consistently inducing FIP support this theory, albeit under experimental conditions. Several researchers speculate that some circulating feline enteric coronaviruses are closer to making critical mutations necessary for development of FIP, possibly explaining FIP outbreaks. No consistent mutation has yet been identified, although studies have suggested sequence differences in the spike protein, membrane protein, or NSP3c correlate with disease manifestation. ***Recent studies have found feline coronaviruses to have intact NSP3c genes, whereas most isolates from diseased tissues of FIP cases had disrupted NSP3c genes.*** Findings suggested that 3c-inactivated viruses only rarely replicate in the intestine, which possibly explains the rare incidence of FIP outbreaks. In additional work, it was concluded that mutation of the S1/S2 locus and modulation of a furin recognition site normally present in the S gene of enteric coronaviruses is a critical contributing factor for development of FIP.\n\nObligatory scientific source: [Merck Veterinary Manual: Feline Infectious Peritonitis](https://www.merckvetmanual.com/generalized-conditions/feline-infectious-peritonitis/overview-of-feline-infectious-peritonitis)\n\nThus, I do wonder if those who develop more severe illness without other known health conditions that make them more likely to become critically ill  may have some sort of genetic susceptibility to severe COVID illness...", "sentiment": -0.9726}, {"id": "hc0sc30", "author": "thaw4188", "parent_id": "pk0kjl", "content": "and certain kinds of long-covid\n\n* ace2: https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0257016\n\n* gpcr: https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3879488", "sentiment": 0.3527}, {"id": "hc1kzsy", "author": "flickering_truth", "parent_id": "pk0kjl", "content": "Is this the same thing as a cytokine storm?", "sentiment": 0.0}, {"id": "hd9ggri", "author": "ColterMilhap", "parent_id": "pk0kjl", "content": "So what does this mean if I had Mono as a teen?", "sentiment": 0.0}], [{"id": "fakavo", "author": "Literally_A_Brain", "parent_id": "", "content": "Compilation of information for health professionals", "sentiment": "", "type": "non_controversial"}, {"id": "fiyog5o", "author": "SignalFaithlessness2", "parent_id": "fakavo", "content": "wow, love everything about this!

The number of lab confirmed cases who are in hospitals is known and most deaths are known.\n\nThis would be the CFR for diagnosed patients which is completely different from CFR for all infected. For influenza most numbers are post-epidemic estimates with estimated numbers for all infected. This would usually be 5-20% of all population. For example 41 million people of 320 million people in US is 12.8% of all people.\n\nSo basically the most comparable rate for influenza is deaths / hospitalizations. Thus:  16 000 deaths / 500,000 hospitalizations = 3.2% CFR for hospital admitted influenza patients in the US. Per the source:  [https://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/burden/preliminary-in-season-estimates.htm](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/burden/preliminary-in-season-estimates.htm)\n\nYou can also do a deaths / lab confirmed flu cases number for the US. Just now there were around 174k lab confirmed influenza cases in the US. This will rise to at least 250k before the season is over. If there are 16 000 deaths per 250 000 lab confirmed flu cases, the CFR for those is 6.4% If a flu patient is confirmed with a lab test as influenza the CFR is over 6%.\n\nEven these numbers should not be compared without detailed info on patient selection. CFR isn't a standardized number which can be compared freely and people should learn that. We do not know post-epidemic all infected CFR of covid19 yet. I'll wager it will be higher than influenza, but by how much I have no idea. I hope it will be only a tad higher than influenza.\n\n**TL;DR:** Not all CFRs are the same.

They've also been in the medical system long enough to have enough information to be included in the study. They went through 77k records and only 44k were included.\n\nMedical visits number isn't that comparable, since those people aren't actually tested and there might be several visits per case. If I experience cough and fever and present myself to the health care system without severe symptoms, they will tell me to go home and recuperate there. They won't waste limited testing resources on everyone with fever and cough as most of them would be something else in any case. They will also recommend people to just stay and recover at home. There's no healthcare system which can handle panicky masses who do not need any care.\n\nThat said, the best comparison number from flu might lie somewhere between hospitalizations and medical visits. Impossible to know at this point though.\n\nIn general current numbers for covid19 do not include people such as:\n\n* Those with no symptoms - asymptomatic\n* Those with mild symptoms who didn't even think of getting care\n* Those with medium symptoms who didn't even think of getting care\n* Those with severe symptoms who didn't even think of getting care\n* Those with mild to medium symptoms who were turned away because it would be unwise to spend any resources on people who can fend for themselves.\n* Those with more severe symptoms, but who were turned away due to resource limits because the symptoms weren't severe enough\n* Those who had any symptoms but the disease ran its cycle before people even started thinking it was anything else than flu.\n* During the peak some people with severe symptoms would be turned away as well.

The patients were admitted to four medical centers in four Chinese provinces between January 18 and February 2. Most either had recently traveled to Wuhan, China, where the outbreak began, or had contact with an infected COVID-19 patient. The cardiothoracic radiologists from Mount Sinai\u2019s BioMedical Engineering and Imaging Institute and its Department of Radiology evaluated each case, took notes of imaging findings, and correlated them with infection time course based on the number of days between symptom onset and the CT scan. Of the 36 patients scanned zero to two days after reporting symptoms, more than half showed no evidence of lung disease\u2014an important finding suggesting that CT scans cannot reliably rule out COVID-19 early in the disease course. For the 33 patients scanned three to five days after symptoms developed, radiologists started to see more patterns of \u201cground glass opacities\u201d (hazy findings in the lungs),  and the abnormalities became more round in shape and more dense. In the 25 patients scanned six to 12 days after symptoms, the scans analysis showed fully involved lung disease. Patterns seen in these images are similar to patterns in related coronavirus outbreaks earlier this century, including SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) and MERS (Middle East respiratory syndrome).\n\nThe conclusions from this study are crucial for prompt diagnosis of COVID-19 as well as for efficient patient isolation. When patients first report symptoms of possible COVID-19, they are nonspecific, often resembling a common cold, so it can be difficult to diagnose. A chest X-ray does not reveal lung disease as well as a CT scan does, and confirmatory tests by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention can take several days. The study allows hospitals in the United States and worldwide to confirm or rule out COVID-19 based on CT images. Additionally, if lung scans for patients with early symptoms are inconclusive, doctors can consider holding the patient in isolation for a few days until the disease can be properly ruled in or ruled out.\n\n\u201cJust as clinicians are evaluating more patients suspected of COVID-19, radiologists are similarly interpreting more chest CTs in those suspected of infection. Chest CT is a vital component in the diagnostic algorithm for patients with suspected infection, particularly given the limited availability and in some cases reliability of test kits,\u201d said lead author Adam Bernheim, MD, Assistant Professor of Diagnostic, Molecular and Interventional Radiology at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai. \u201cThese investigative efforts not only show patterns of imaging findings in a large number of patients, but they also demonstrate that frequency of CT findings is related to disease time course. Recognizing imaging patterns based on infection time course is paramount for not only understanding the disease process and natural history of COVID-19, but also for helping to predict patient progression and potential complication development.\u201d", "sentiment": 0.4498}, {"id": "fj00xc1", "author": "Negarnaviricota", "parent_id": "fakavo", "content": "A thought regarding the CFR.\n\nThere are clear evidences that the CFR observed in Hubei (currently sitting at 4% and estimated to grow to 5-7%) is far higher the the CFR observed in the rest of China (currently at 0.81% and estimated to grow to 1-2%), or the CFR observed in rest of the world, probably due to the inevitably low detection rate in Wuhan, Hubei.\n\nHowever, all three references regarding the CFR are based on Chinese data (which is essentially represented by Hubei, since Hubei represents over 80% of Chinese cases and \\~80% of total cases).

At the interim analysis, molnupiravir reduced the risk of hospitalization or death by approximately 50%; 7.3% of patients who received molnupiravir were either hospitalized or died through Day 29 following randomization (28/385), compared with 14.1% of placebo-treated patients (53/377); p=0.0012. Through Day 29, no deaths were reported in patients who received molnupiravir, as compared to 8 deaths in patients who received placebo. At the recommendation of an independent Data Monitoring Committee and in consultation with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), recruitment into the study is being stopped early due to these positive results. Merck plans to submit an application for Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) to the U.S. FDA as soon as possible based on these findings and plans to submit marketing applications to other regulatory bodies worldwide.\n\n...\n\n>**About the Results of the Planned Interim Analysis**\n\n>The planned interim analysis evaluated data from 775 patients who were initially enrolled in the Phase 3 MOVe-OUT trial on or prior to Aug. 5, 2021. At the time of the decision to stop recruitment based on the compelling interim efficacy results, the trial was approaching full recruitment of the Phase 3 sample size of 1,550 patients, with more than 90% of the intended sample size already enrolled.\n\n>Eligibility criteria required that all patients had laboratory-confirmed mild-to-moderate COVID-19, with symptom onset within 5 days of study randomization. All patients were required to have at least one risk factor associated with poor disease outcome at study entry. Molnupiravir reduced the risk of hospitalization and/or death across all key subgroups; efficacy was not affected by timing of symptom onset or underlying risk factor. Additionally, based on the participants with available viral sequencing data (approximately 40% of participants), molnupiravir demonstrated consistent efficacy across viral variants Gamma, Delta, and Mu.\n\n>The incidence of any adverse event was comparable in the molnupiravir and placebo groups (35% and 40%, respectively). Similarly, the incidence of drug-related adverse events was also comparable (12% and 11%, respectively).

The conclusion (at the bottom) is very positive!\n\n> #Comparison 1: **Ivermectin** treatment versus control\n\n> **Analysis 1.1: Death**\n\n> Moderate certainty evidence indicates that **ivermectin** probably reduces deaths by an average 83% (95% CI, 65% to 92%) compared with no **ivermectin** treatment (5 RCTs, 1107 participants; RR 0.17, 95% 0.08 to 0.35; risk of death 1.4% versus 8.4% among participants in this analysis)\n\n> **Analysis 1.2: Condition improvement**\n\n> Data for \u2018mild to moderate COVID-19\u2019 and \u2018severe\u2019 COVID-19\u2019 subgroups were not pooled for this outcome because the statistical test for subgroup differences indicates that the effect size is not the same for these subgroups. Moderate certainty evidence suggests that **ivermectin** probably increases the likelihood of people with mild to moderate COVID-19 improving by about 34% (22% to 48%) (5 studies, 743 participants; RR 1.34, 95% CI 1.22 to 1.48; evidence certainty downgraded for study design limitations) compared with no **ivermectin** treatment.\n\n> For those with severe COVID-19 infection, low certainty evidence suggests that it may increase the likelihood of improvement by a greater extent than for mild to moderate infections (1 study, 200 participants, RR 1.88, 95% CI 1.54 to 2.30). This evidence was downgraded to low certainty because of study design limitations and because it was derived from a single small study.\n\n> **Analysis 1.3: Condition deterioration**\n\n> Moderate certainty evidence suggests that **ivermectin** probably reduces the risk of a person\u2019s condition deteriorating by about 53% (95% CI 23% to 71%) compared with no **ivermectin** treatment (5 studies, 1175 participants; RR 0.47, 95% CI 0.29 to 0.77).\n\n> **Analysis 1.4: Recovery time (clinical), as measured by study authors**\n\n> For the subgroup of studies evaluating **ivermectin** as an outpatient treatment for COVID-19 infection, low certainty evidence suggests that **ivermectin** may reduce recovery time compared with no **ivermectin** treatment by about a day (2 studies, 176 participants; MD - 1.06, 95% CI -1.63 to -0.49). Although the effect is consistent across the two studies in this subgroup, the evidence was downgraded for imprecision1 and study design limitations.\n\n> Evidence on the effect of **ivermectin** on recovery time among people treated in hospital (subgroup analysis 1.4.2 and 1.4.3 in the forest plot below) similarly require more data to improve the certainty of this evidence.\n\n> **Analysis 1.5: Recovery time to a negative PCR test**\n\n> Low certainty evidence from two studies among outpatients suggests that **ivermectin** may reduce the time to a negative PCR test by about two days compared with no **ivermectin** treatment (2 studies, 186 participants; MD -1.88, 95% CI -3.62 to -0.15). The evidence was downgraded for imprecision and study design limitations.\n\n> **Analysis 1.6: Length of hospital stay**\n\n> The evidence presented here is based on a sensitivity analysis whereby study data at high risk of bias (Elgazzar 2020) were excluded pending author query. The resulting low certainty evidence suggests that **ivermectin** may reduce the length of hospital stay by about a day in people with mild to moderate COVID-19 infection (2 studies, participants; MD -1.03, 95% CI -1.82 to -0.23; downgraded for study design limitations and imprecision).\n\n> **Outcome 1.8. Admission to ICU or requiring ventilation**\n\n> Low certainty evidence from a single OCT suggests that **ivermectin** may lead to potentially large reductions in the number of people with COVID-19 infections requiring ICU admission (248 participants; RR 0.11, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.80). The evidence for this outcome was downgraded due to design limitations and imprecision.\n\n> **Outcome 1.9: Severe adverse events**\n\n> These findings are of very low certainty. It is not possible to determine whether the two adverse events in the Mahmud 2020 study were due to **ivermectin** or doxycycline; however, esophagitis (the adverse event reported) is a known adverse effect associated with doxycycline.

IMO she is being careful and *explicit* about discerning bias in the *studies*, which adds to her credibility.\n\n> Give me a real, peer-reviewed, properly controlled RCT of ivermectin. \n\nUnfortunately I don't think that exists. I was surprised to learn *last night* that there are 18 ivermectin RCTs. I don't have a list of them. The best list I could find didn't have any RCTs that meet your requirements. *Peer reviewed* scotches most of them, I suppose because there's a long queue of studies waiting for review. [Here](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.01.05.21249131v1), for example, is a new study with positive results for ivermectin. It's new -- which means it won't be peer reviewed for several months. The first completed ivermectin trial was ICON, an observational study done in Broward County, FL. It took about 5 months for that study to appear in a journal.\n\nDuring a pandemic, when recently 4100 Americans died in one day, insisting on peer review is ridiculous. IMO.\n\n> Enough with cobbling together small observational studies and treating it as equal to RCTs.\n\nA few responses:\n\n1) I have read an estimate that 80% of modern medical practice is not based on RCTs -- or *any* evidence. Dr. Daniel Griffin on TWiV described the process of figuring things out during the initial covid wave in NYC. Very rough paraphrase: \"It could come down to a matter of luck and timing: two men in similar condition are scheduled to go on ventilators, one IS put on a ventilator and but they haven't gotten around to the other, when the doctor drops by and sees that the patient on the ventilator is doing much worse compared to the other who is still waiting. This helped us figure out that the ventilators weren't helping many patients.\"\n\nDoctors can be fooled. \"I gave the patient X and the patient got better, so X must work.\" When *many* doctors around the world (ivermectin is being used in 21 countries) are finding that ivermectin works with hundreds or thousands of patients, though, that lends weight IMO. There *are* reports by doctors who found that ivermectin was *not* effective, but they are few, greatly outweighed by others offering their positive experiences. Does that prove anything? Not by scientific standards -- but it contributes to the growing consensus that ivermectin works. I imagine you will agree that it would reflect poorly on the drug if the vast majority of informal reports by physicians were that ivermectin does NOT work.\n\n2) RCTs are the gold standard but [Conchrane](https://www.cochrane.org/MR000034/METHOD_comparing-effect-estimates-of-randomized-controlled-trials-and-observational-studies) found that:\n\n> Our results provide little evidence for significant effect estimate differences between observational studies and RCTs, regardless of specific observational study design, heterogeneity, inclusion of pharmacological studies, or use of propensity score adjustment. Factors other than study design per se need to be considered when exploring reasons for a lack of agreement between results of RCTs and observational studies.\n\nWe're all taught that science is fraught with mistaken inferences from observational studies. Vitamin D is an example where observed correlations were disproven by RCTs. However, Cochrane's systematic analysis of the issue gives lie to the conventional belief that we can only learn from RCTs. \n\n3) Cobbling together studies is perfectly respectable. In fact, meta-analyses are [the highest form of evidence](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Yilda_Aba/publication/321484899/figure/fig1/AS:616365106921482@1523964301786/Hierarchy-of-Evidence-Khoja-2010.png). The ivermectin research is flawed. Nonetheless, *three* meta-analyses have found that the compiled evidence is persuasive. *Multiple* meta-analyses must be at the tippy-top of the pyramid.\n\nI agree that a proper RCT is would be great: nice big N, double-blinded, multi-institutional, etc. Unfortunately there is no financial incentive for funding such a trial, because ivermectin is off-label and dirt cheap. In India a dose costs 50 cents. The RECOVERY trial that found dexamethasone useful was funded in part by the UK's equivalent to NIH. Unfortunately NIH has not elected to fund an ivermectin trial.\n\nMaybe it's worth mentioning that Gilead had a huge financial incentive to fund proper RCTs of Remdesivir, which led to the FDA issuing an EUA. That drug *barely* works, if at all: didn't an independent trial find no effect? IMO it's likely that $50 worth of ivermectin would speed recovery more than a $3000 course of Remdesivir -- based on the evidence.\n\nOn 2021-01-06, three doctors well-versed in the ivermectin research, one of them the author of a meta-analysis, presented the data to NIH's COVID-19 Treat\u00adment Guidelines Panel, which said it would review and update its ivermectin recommendation. Will that lead to NIH funding that proper RCT? Maybe. Could it be completed in the relevant timeframe? Maybe.\n\nI can tell from your tone that you're skeptical about ivermectin and aren't likely to be persuaded -- but I hope you found this answer at least a little satisfying.", "sentiment": 0.9942}, {"id": "gilsbvc", "author": "joegtech", "parent_id": "gi7b9k7", "content": ">This paper is not quite complete: it reports 10 RCTs; I think there are 11. ...  \n>  \n>Carvallo Argentina prophylaxis study...is  too good to believe.

This is the fourth such retrospective VE estimate paper which ostensible shows a negative VE at certain timeframes post-vaccination. The other three have incongruent timeframes for when this happens, as I mention. Thus they are clearly confounded by local prior (or concurrent) spread of Delta. \n\nWe have seen this *exact same pattern* before, with the 2009 pandemic. It is a classic presentation of viral interference or cryptic infections prior to very specific retrospective measurements of VE. And I have said that other study designs, such as a test-negative design, do a better job at adjusting for this. As would a rolling year-long period of inclusion as compared to a short retrospective slice. In the case of Omicron waves, it's understandable why that latter option isn't taken, because it's not yet possible.\n\nMy language was quite conservative, just brief.

Among 7606 patients, in-hospital death or mechanical ventilation occurred in 2109 (27.7%), in-hospital death in 1302 (17.1%), and mechanical ventilation in 1602 (21.1%). After multivariable adjustment, classes I to III obesity were associated with higher risks of in-hospital death or mechanical ventilation (odds ratio, 1.28 [95% CI, 1.09\u20131.51], 1.57 [1.29\u20131.91], 1.80 [1.47\u20132.20], respectively), and class III obesity was associated with a higher risk of in-hospital death (hazard ratio, 1.26 [95% CI, 1.00\u20131.58]).

Significant BMI by age interactions were seen for all primary end points (P-interaction<0.05 for each), such that the association of BMI with death or mechanical ventilation was strongest in adults \u226450 years, intermediate in adults 51 to 70 years, and weakest in adults >70 years. Severe obesity (BMI \u226540 kg/m2) was associated with an increased risk of in-hospital death only in those \u226450 years (hazard ratio, 1.36 [1.01\u20131.84]).

I do agree that, from what I've seen, the CDC hasn't done a great job. However, I genuinely don't think that the UK public health authority communications have been misleading thus far, and not in this case either, since this has been available not just (arguably) buried in the ONS reports, but [clearly presented on their dashboard](https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/healthandsocialcare/conditionsanddiseases/articles/coronaviruscovid19latestinsights/deaths#pre-existing-health-conditions). Not to mention, until this latest (Omicron) wave, there hasn't been any need to deal with deaths without any other cause, as the 'Deaths within 28 days of positive test by date of death' has \\*very\\* closely tracked both 'Daily deaths with COVID-19 on the death certificate by date of death' \\*and\\* excess deaths. Thus my position that this 17,000 figure is basically useless.\n\nI mentioned the latest wave and the two main metrics for death here - well, they \\*have\\* begun to diverge, to the point where we are now recording twice the likely real figure. So this is something to keep an eye on, and we will most likely have to stop using the 28 days metric and fall back on the death certificate one, with the downside that it runs 11 days late due to the need to verify death certs. Once again, this does not validate the 'deaths with COVID as sole cause' metric, because it simply isn't useful, nor is it how deaths from disease are normally recorded or reported. That brings me to your request for evidence. The phrase I used was \"any given\", not \"any\". My bad for unintentional exaggeration I suppose, since it's very clear just from these stats that sole cause deaths are quite possible (17k of them in the case of COVID). I should have said \"most\", which I really don't think is a controversial position since we can see from the COVID stats alone that COVID as an \\*underlying cause\\* produces a figure far, far higher than sole cause, and still tracks excess deaths very well. Thus there are indeed multiple causes of death on the majority of death certificates for COVID and there's no reason to assume (without embarking on a load of research for which I simply don't have time) that other diseases don't produce similarly high numbers of multiple cause death certs. That said, [here's some evidence](https://www.aihw.gov.au/reports/life-expectancy-death/multiple-causes-of-death-in-australia-an-analysis/contents/methods) from Australia (quote \"in the majority of deaths, more than one disease is indicated as causing or significantly contributing to the death.\").", "sentiment": -0.9968}, {"id": "htz43mu", "author": "amosanonialmillen", "parent_id": "htyczpn", "content": "Thanks for your mature response and apology.

Exposure dose and route of infection are relevant variables. In fact, it is likely that the majority of persons who escape clinical infections during Flu outbreaks could in part be explained by a lifestyle that limits the level of infection. Those of us who have few close interactions with others, and especially if we adopt a non-affectionate behavior pattern, are less likely to receive high dose infections. However, quantitative effects of infection can only be assessed by control studies in experimental animals. Influenza virus infections in mice have been used for this purpose ([Legge and Braciale, 2005](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2019.02314/full#B66)). In such studies, animals given a high dose all developed disease and this could be lethal. The deaths seemed to be the consequence of the otherwise protective CD8 T cell response being suppressed. The suppression was explained by plasmacytoid DC, which express Fas-ligand upon Flu infection, making contact with Fas-expressing CD8 effector T cells causing these otherwise protective cells to undergo apoptosis. A similar form of plasmacytoid DC/leucocyte interaction could explain the lymphopenia which occurs with virulent H5N1 flu infection ([Langlois and Legge, 2010](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2019.02314/full#B64)). At lower doses of flu infection, other types of DC were preferentially infected but these cells fail to express Fas-ligand permitting protective T cells to survive. At even lower doses of virus one can assume the virus is fully controlled by innate defenses and adaptive aspects of immunity may not be induced.\n\nA few years back when infection experiments in chimpanzees were still permitted, some remarkable observations on the infection dose effects was reported by the Chisari group ([Asabe et al., 2009](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2019.02314/full#B7)). They showed that when animals were infected with between 104 to 108 virions of hepatitis B virus, animals developed mild hepatitis and readily controlled the disease. However, infection at a higher dose resulted in damaging chronic active hepatitis thought to be an immuno-pathological response to the infection. Surprisingly, infecting chimpanzees with a minimal dose which could be as low as 100 virions gave the same outcome as those infected with greater than 108 virions. Explanations for these observations were not at hand but it could have related to the virus avoiding contact and elimination by some aspect of innate immunity, but still able to present antigens to induce an unbalanced T cell response that mediated tissue damage.\"", "sentiment": -0.9745}, {"id": "fishf57", "author": "MrStupidDooDooDumb", "parent_id": "fipr214", "content": "Hi, sorry I never got back to this.

[Michael Anthony Epstein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_A._Epstein) and [Yvonne Barr](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yvonne_Barr), who originally discovered the \"type specimen\" of the virus as the cause of Burkitt's Lymphoma (a common childhood cancer in sub-Saharan Africa).  It's subsequently been found to be the cause of mononucleosis or \"kissing fever\" (though the \"mono EBV\" is a different serotype), and it's one of over eight known herpesviruses in humans.  It also typically causes no symptoms in most people.\n\n(Herpesviruses in general have a neat trick in that they can hang out in the nervous system--which has a different immune system than the rest of the body--for decades not really causing trouble until the \"main body\" immunity gets weakened.  Chickenpox or varicella--another herpesvirus--and the two types of herpes simplex (I will resist the urge to nickname herpes simplex 2 \"herpes not-so-simplex\" as it's the common cause of genital herpes) are actually good examples of this--you get an initial infection, and the body keeps it in check (and from getting out of the nerves)...until it doesn't, which is when you get shingles (when the body's immunity to varicella wears down) or a cold sore (herpes simplex 1) or a flareup of the Not-So-Simplex Herpes (herpes simplex 2).  This is also a reason why shingles in particular tends to flare up along specific large nerves and why it's *infamously* painful.)\n\nAnd as others have noted, it's not unknown or even uncommon for people who've recovered from an illness to still shed virus for some time.

The scientific community can ONLY work with the info they have, though, and (unfortunately) the epicentre of where COVID-19 apparently made the leap from either bats or pangolins into humans...had some significant delays in even informing the rest of the PRC (much less the world!) about the disease because the prefecture governor was more intent on Not Rocking The Boat than actually trying to stop an emerging infectious disease.  And *outside of the PRC*, we're really only in the first month (really, the first few weeks) of being able to observe and get good scientific data without, well, Executive Mismanagement by the CCP et al.\n\nAs much as we'd all like the researchers to Science The Things Right Now, they are not Time Lords, they do not have a TARDIS to speed things up, and the World Health Organization and the CDC and equivalent public health agencies do not have a convenient Gallifreyan extension they can call on (nor do they have access to Marty McFly's Special Delorean, nor has Pfizer found the secret to making melange so that Navigators may be appointed to literally fold space and time).  These things do unfortunately take time, and...it's NOT unknown for bugs to burn out by the time they've been properly Scienced.  (COVID-19 might be the first of the emerging coronaviruses that lets us actually do investigational new drug trials of antivirals, for one; SARS and MERS burned out before a vaccine could be completed or INDs of antivirals could progress much beyond initial safety tests in humans.)\n\nSo until a vaccine is made, or the equivalent of Tamiflu or one of those wonder drugs for hep-C (that you wonder how one six-week course of drugs can cost $35,000 in the US) comes out to treat COVID-19:  Keep calm.

MAYBE stock up on some things (like medicines and SOME foodstuffs and supplements) that you know are of Chinese origin or use ingredients of Chinese origin (for prescription stuff, you'll want to talk with your doctor on this, they may have to do *convincing* of insurance companies in the US).  Keep 14 days to a month of water and easily-preparable shelf-stable food (which is a good idea ANYWAYS, COVID-19 or no; there's plenty of non-infectious stuff that can cause disruptions in food and water supplies, like hurricanes and tornadoes and severe thunderstorms/derecho events and earthquakes and forest fires and even really bad snowstorms).\n\nBut it's not the end of the world, COVID-19 will eventually tame down to next generation's Con Crud, and between the virus mutating to be less deadly and humans having finely honed immune systems with experience at fighting off this sort of thing as long as there have been humans, and arguably 600 million years of experience dating from when living things first started having immune systems...it's not the end of the world.

The \"perfect virus\" would be something akin to the milder \"common colds\"--causing JUST enough symptoms to spread via aerosol, but not killing the host, probably not even causing enough of a reaction in the host to get them to stop their activities because they feel like poo.)\n\nThe main trick in \"Sciencing againist COVID-19\" in this case is getting a vaccine and effective antivirals produced and in the population before the virus burns itself out (SARS and MERS burned out before we could do this, COVID-19 is better at spreading and isn't quite as deadly) or evolves into a bad chest cold (like, oh, the many, many other coronaviruses that have historically infected our ancestors and could well have been that era's version of COVID-19 but which are now...chest colds).  It's that part that takes time, but the good news is that this is being worked on probably the fastest of ANY emerging infectious disease.\n\nAgain, I'll compare with Ebola.  Ebola was first discovered in the mid-70s.  Scientists have been working on Ebola vaccines and treatments for at least the past two decades, and it was only this year that an effective Ebola vaccine was fast-tracked for FDA approval; likewise for most of the antivirals that are in use.  We only really have a hint on the definitive host of Ebola--namely, we know bats are a reservoir species (because bats have wonderfully weird immune systems that can pretty much let them be carriers of a lot of diseases without actually getting sick), and we know certain kinds of rats and chimpanzees are secondary hosts.\n\nLet's compare with COVID-19...we have about three weeks of epidemiological data from outside the PRC (thanks to the governor of Hubei prefecture trying to Not Rock The Boat, we probably missed out on two to six months of research on this from its beginnings).  Thanks to practice we've had with SARS and MERS (before those two diseases burned themselves out) we have an expected date of a working vaccine for COVID-19 six months to a year from now (which is really incredibly, incredibly fast; usually even \"investigational new vaccines\" only given to members of the military to protect against potential bioweapons, like the anthrax shot and modern smallpox vaccines, take 2-3 years of development before they even hit clinical trials).  We already have antivirals in the pipeline and investigational new drug trials testing out certain antiretrovirals in COVID-19 patients (which, again, is incredibly fast--this stuff normally takes half a decade).  We have a pretty full genetic map of COVID-19 and have been able to trace potential origins to specific bat coronaviruses, quite possibly with a \"rest stop\" in pangolins that allowed some recombination with pangolin coronaviruses that enabled the spread to us (especially with NOT really having records of where the virus may have come from before Wuhan, this is actually *really freaking amazing* that potential hosts can be found that fast; it  took us the better part of a year to find the natural host of Sin Nombre hantavirus despite *Dine traditional knowledge knowing about deer mice as a vector* (we now know Sin Nombre was actually a re-emerging virus) and it took over 30 years to narrow down bats as a potential Ebola reservoir species).", "sentiment": 0.9859}, {"id": "fianry3", "author": "ic33", "parent_id": "fiadyz4", "content": "Chill, man-- my post history mostly agrees with you; I was just adding some nuance / what we need to be aware of (even if it does eventually saturate in the human population, there could be a whole lot of mortality then and a whole lot of morbidity afterwards).

Even with good development, we probably don't end up with enough vaccine doses in winter to make a massive difference initially (what do you do with, say, 50k/week initial production rate?  if developed in US, high priority health care workers *here*?  do you allocate a big chunk to China?  and for something that hasn't been fully investigated with our normal depth of safety trials... even a low risk of complications could be *worse* than the virus, so giving to your most critical personnel immediately is a bit scary), so it's a big question as to what nature decides to do for how quick and widespread that Fall resurgence is (or if it even happens, but it seems likelier than not to me it will).\n\nedit: Antiretrovirals, etc, are great and all, because they already exist in inventories, have existing production lines, and can maybe improve mortality and morbidity for a big chunk of existing patients.

Prophylactics that can be given to health care workers and eventually in a \"firewall\" around quarantines are IMO much, much, much more important in changing the course of the disease.

Whilst measles is still nasty, *early* measles was like canine distemper (which crossed over much more recently from rinderpest) in that it had something like a 60% fatality rate or higher.\n\nb) Syphilis (which was introduced into European populations circa the 1500s--whilst still a nasty disease (especially if untreated and allowed to go into tertiary syphilis) it was a remarkably deadly disease in its 1500s form (such that it gained the name \"the great pox\"--the course of illness was quite a bit accelerated from the present, with infection to death from a particularly severe form of tertiary syphilis involving multiple gummas being as short as 2-3 years), essentially to the Renaissance Era what HIV and AIDS was to the 80s before highly effective retrovirals.\n\nc) The Spanish flu (yes, DAT Flu).  H1N1 flus are still rough compared to ordinary flu, but modern H1N1 flus (all of which are genetic descendants of the original \"Spanish flu\" via two lineages--one in humans, one in pigs) are *considerably* less nasty than the cytokine-storm-causing Flu From Hell that has been arguably blamed for the end of World War II.\n\nd) Ebola (yes, seriously).  The initial outbreaks of Ebola Zaire were around 90% fatal (and burned out very quickly), subsequent Ebola outbreaks and subtypes have actually been lowering in fatality rate (around 60%)--and considering that until recently there was no Ebola vaccine and no effective antiviral treatment for Ebola, this is very likely evolution of the virus itself.  (Another thing pointing to this is that larger outbreaks of Ebola have been, in general, the less blatantly fatal serotypes with death rates closer to Lassa Fever.)\n\nIt's spreading at its present virulence level, yes, but--here's the thing--a lot of the selections for virulence have a tendency to \"tame down\" viruses (yes, the genetic mutations that make them easier to spread actually can make them less deadly) and it is *not* to the genetic advantage of a virus to kill its infectee--what helps it survive and propogate and do its Virus Thing is actually keeping the host alive but shedding virus.  (Retroviruses in particular have raised this to a black art--we actually have remnants of retroviruses in our DNA that infected human (and pre-human) ancestors long ago and actually incorporated themselves into the genetic code.  Retroviruses, unlike a lot of virus families, actually don't explode a cell in reproduction but hijack the cellular manufacturing process a little more efficiently.)\n\nIf viruses didn't lose virulence over time (or diseases in general), we'd be dealing with killer avian flu (like \"worse than Spanish Flu level\" stuff) literally every flu season, we'd be having COVID-19 about 500 times over (something like 20% of your viruses that cause the \"common cold\" are actually coronaviruses that jumped species generations ago, quite possibly were as bad as COVID-19 when they first jumped species, but now...are just chest colds), syphilis would be Extremely Obvious as an STD as it'd make people look like plague zombies before killing them (compete with the weeping sores), and we'd be having death rates from measles far closer to those experienced in recently-contacted peoples who are completely naive to the disease (note: measles epidemics have killed off 90-95% of recently contacted peoples at times, this is why forced contact of uncontacted peoples is Frowned Upon nowadays).  Oh, and smallpox would have probably wiped out 95% of the world population (did I mention smallpox in its initial forms tended to manifest as a haemorrhagic fever not unlike Ebola?  And it tended to do that in naive populations, like the Mandan First Nation that was almost completely wiped out from haemorrhagic smallpox).  So there's that.\n\n(Now, the main issue is that it does take time for viruses to evolve this way to better \"match their hosts without killing them\".

We actually have been able to trace the genetics of the \"Spanish flu\" (via samples gathered from persons who lived in extremely isolated Yup'ik communities in Alaska who died of the \"Spanish flu\" and whose bodies were preserved when buried in permafrost), which is how we know modern H1N1 human flu and \"swine flu\" are in fact descended from the Spanish flu.  And no, I'm not being facetious or argumentative; I'd honestly like to see an alternate explanation of decreased morbidity/mortality of H1N1 flus, especially as there have been genetic mutations found (between \"Spanish Flu\" at the time it jumped to humans, versus modern human H1N1 flus and even H1N1 \"swine flus\" showing specific changes in both contagiousness and disease effects that would impact morbidity and mortality--changes in genes that are actually helping track potential virulence and morbidity/mortality potential of other avian flus that have shown evidence of trying to hop species like H5N1 flu.)", "sentiment": -0.9895}, {"id": "fic0rbf", "author": "kusuriurikun", "parent_id": "fibukxm", "content": "I did not claim to be psychic, but pretty much if you study any infectious disease's history, the tendency (and I'm specifically referring to the tendency here) is for a virus to do one of two things:\n\na) Evolve over time to be less likely to kill a host.  (This has happened *provably* for H1N1 flu, has also shown strong evidence of happening for multiple other diseases including measles, and there's strong evidence this has occurred in past with human coronaviruses. \n\nb) Burn out because it runs out of hosts, quite possibly because it's TOO good at killing its hosts or it fails to propagate.  (Ebola--though it's showing trends at \"taming down\"; Sin Nombre hantavirus; the Black Death; whatever caused the Plague of Athens historically that Thuciclydes described, whether it was filoviral or possibly some other disease; the Picardy Sweat; many other diseases historically).\n\nEven smallpox seems to have calmed down over time ([variola minor or alastrim becoming the dominant form of smallpox in the US and Commonwealth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alastrim) in the earliest 20th Century and eventually becoming the last form of smallpox in the wild before it was wiped out in the mid-seventies--it's actually theorized alastrim NOT killing most of its patients (around a \"bad flu year\" 2% death rate versus the usual 20-30% for variola major in non-naive populations and closer to 60-90% mortality in naive populations) gave it a significant survival advantage).\n\nI seriously, SERIOUSLY doubt that somehow COVID-19 is going to be the Grand Exception to a trend that has occurred with human viruses (and for that matter, human infectious diseases in general) of remaining both \"super-infectious and super-deadly\".  If (or more properly, the odds are likely to be *when*, not if--but we'll be diplomatic and say \"if\") a mutation occurs that makes COVID-19 less likely to throw someone into full-blown pneumonia but still allows it to survive (and in fact may make it more transmissible, because people won't be pretty much ready to go into the hospital)...THAT variation is likely to have a survival advantage, simply because people will treat it more like a bad chest cold than SARS 2.0.  This is simple, pure Occam's Razor here.\n\nViruses that kill people tend to be very aggressively treated by humans and quarantined and treated as Bad Things, which (even aside from the fact that a virus can't reproduce well in a host if it kills the host in the process) does not exactly help the long-term survival of the virus as a disease.  \n\n(Put more bluntly: People passed alastrim more than \"classical smallpox\" in the early 20th century because alastrim typically didn't have close to a 1 in 3 chance of killing you and had milder symptoms--you didn't go into the classical \"pocks\" as much, you were still well enough to move around and do things.  Smallpox, pretty much health departments were shutting down apartment buildings just like the Chinese government does with COVID-19 (and people *were* all but welded into their houses--more commonly, kept in their houses or sent to sanatoria by literal gunpoint if necessary) and doing mass ring immunization (again, occasionally by literal gunpoint) when smallpox was found--there was a distinct advantage for a Subtler Smallpox, even in crowded cities.)\n\nYou see, I'm *not* just counting the effects of \"random mutation in X population\" and \"does a milder virus have an easier time spreading in Chennai\"--public health measures *in and of themselves* actually have to be considered as part of the natural history of an emerging infectious disease, and in cases where pretty much anyone showing obvious symptoms of \"classical COVID-19\" is likely to be subjected to quarantine...simple evolution *will* in time favour a \"COVID-19 descendant\" that is better adapted to the human body and less likely to throw one into the hospital, or the disease will *in time* burn itself out, either via running out of hosts (because everyone is immune and/or it's killed everyone potentially infectable) or running out of hosts (in that effective antivirals, prophylactics, and vaccines are widely available and pretty much Science The Fuck out of the existence of the disease).\n\n(And honestly, the former scenario...COVID-19 eventually getting into ENOUGH of a symbiosis with humans over time that eventually humans will be immune enough--and the virus having acquired enough \"survive in humans without killing them\" beneficial mutations...is the most likely.  I won't lie in that the \"adaptation period\" is probably Not Going To Be Fun, but it's certainly NOT going to be a literal \"28 Days After\"/\"I Am Legend\"/\"The Stand\" type of Infectious Disease Apocalypse that wipes out most of humanity and throws us back to the Early Medieval Period. It's also unlikely at this point that it's going to completely burn itself out or be stamped out before it has the chance to evolve (thanks, PRC government :/). It's almost certainly NOT going to remain \"infectious or deadly\", though; the history of infectious diseases as long as humans have been documenting them show one or the other ultimately will give.)\n\nI am also patiently (and without personal attacks, unlike yourself) asking again for your hypothesis on why H1N1 flus in humans and swine (both of which actually are traceable genetically and epidemiologically to the original late 1910s \"Spanish Flu\", a novel H1N1 influenza virus) are significantly less severe in their effects than the H1N1 flu from the late 1910s through at least the 1930s, despite world events (including World War II; the rise of megacities; mass human refugee crises; Europe having concentration camps that were literally breeding disease and the Soviet Union having gulags that were also plague factories because of the horrible conditions wherein; the rise of world travel, particularly travel by air and car; and the human population increasing by sixfold in general and reaching well over a billion people in China and India alone) that--by your stated hypothesis that diseases do not necessarily \"tame down\" in crowded conditions--should have resulted in preservation of something related to wild-type H1N1 (1918 serotype) that had equivalent morbidity and mortality to the original \"Spanish Flu\" serotypes.\n\n(Again, not being facetious.  I'd honestly like to hear your explanation as to why people were not dropping dead en masse during World War II from the Spanish Flu 2.0.  Or why Vietnamese refugee camps weren't having 1918-esque morbidity and mortality rates.  Or why China didn't see similar rates, and why Woodstock wasn't the epicentre of an H1N1 pandemic of similar severity to the \"Spanish Flu\".  No matter what your theory is, I'm curious as to your explanation as to why we're not seeing Spanish Flu now, even in the more distinctly crowded parts of the world.)\n\n(I'm also curious as to your explanation as to why there are definite changes in genetic markers in modern H1N1 flus versus H1N1(1918) specifically associated with morbidity and mortality--especially increased triggering of cytokine floods and *possibly* some neurological effects with H1N1(1918) versus modern H1N1 flus.

On March, when Germany started to feel tremors of Covid me and my colleagues got to together to see the relationship of UVB, Vitamin D and Covid deaths. We went ahead and wrote a paper regarding the role of UV Index and Vitamin D in reducing the number of deaths. The study indicates that there is a significant link between UVB radiation (produces vitamin D) and COVID-19 deaths.\n\nQuick background on vitamin D. As you know, there were of indications that vitamin D may be the blindspot in the whole pandemic. COVID-19 occured in winter, disproportionately affecting elderly, male, obsese people, people with co-morbidities and people of color - e.g., minorities (black, asian, middle-east) , nursing care home residents. Major clusters of COVID-19 is above 35 degree North latitude (e.g., New York, Qom(Iran), Lombardy, London, New Jersey).Studies indicate that vitamin D deficiency is linked to many of these factors.Little vitamin D can be produced between Nov and April, especially people with skin pigmentation produces vitamin D more slowly.\n\nAfter controlling for time-constant and time-varying factors, the study finds that a permanent unit increase in UV Index is associated with a 2.2 percentage points decline in daily growth rates of cumulative COVID-19 deaths \\[p < 0.01\\] as well as a 1.9 percentage points decline in the daily growth rates of case fatality ratio (CFR) \\[p < 0.05\\]. These results translate into a significant percentage reduction in terms of the daily growth rates of cumulative COVID-19 deaths (-22.92%) and CFR (-73.08%).\n\nEnsuring sensible sunlight exposure is the best way for vitamin D production.If sunlight exposure is not possible, one should try to have balanced food rich in vitamin D (Tuna, Salmon, Mackerel, Sardine, eggs etc) or vitamin D supplements (check your health providers website for required intake) to boost your immunity levels.\n\nSimilar research for University of Dublin also concluded the same.Here is the news from Telegrapgh UK and NYPOST: [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2020/05/03/time-take-seriously-link-vitamin-d-deficiency-serious-covid/](https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.telegraph.co.uk%2Fnews%2F2020%2F05%2F03%2Ftime-take-seriously-link-vitamin-d-deficiency-serious-covid%2F%3Ffbclid%3DIwAR3RZDTyO66gj-yp7uEct3Yi52eceX0GiDv5v7elGSB1KYQJZuagbnn_wTY&h=AT2x9601xC0fYOqQ_2-E37noixY2EcNRotquRk9Ui8SlWBJqhdNbdYWOZuh3OZs05DVwN76WUpc1EnWtC5FGuxuVdnJcymZ_kgujcOnhaPu9WaYwD9LiIuIBVAvbxMZGzIg41q1f528yqADJ1vVy&__tn__=-UK-R&c[0]=AT285vFGWJ6ZoR63f7JxsRf-e5BlsHTNEwZRLyt1Vjb4Y-FFEqli5m2HrT057u3hrtYhBdLIobnCAF3oQDuE3lb_fFAnPYS8Y6iVFBOCJh_FEsy3OINe8QcTt5TWPQLq-Uxfc7Ei)[https://nypost.com/2020/05/01/people-with-low-vitamin-d-levels-more-likely-to-die-from-coronavirus-study-finds/](https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fnypost.com%2F2020%2F05%2F01%2Fpeople-with-low-vitamin-d-levels-more-likely-to-die-from-coronavirus-study-finds%2F%3Ffbclid%3DIwAR37Lssq8wFRH9MSN5Z9MC67lpbQDS9bE3ww-mag38NcR_HtzBIqXcn3zFg&h=AT2fxqAn5cqZaDq7oskPNmXWDdtWBMq7e2vxTzHJqNV5WEeFyvbjztBKFBTs2_HwKixDKZEXfR15rJRbuE2_48Qlf7tRNUonRK8Wq-7HiNLcYt-g1GERQXY3sJyNjROwPPzESIh8PJCxCFmjEC02&__tn__=-UK-R&c[0]=AT285vFGWJ6ZoR63f7JxsRf-e5BlsHTNEwZRLyt1Vjb4Y-FFEqli5m2HrT057u3hrtYhBdLIobnCAF3oQDuE3lb_fFAnPYS8Y6iVFBOCJh_FEsy3OINe8QcTt5TWPQLq-Uxfc7Ei)\n\nLink to our research, soon to be published by University of Frankfurt: [https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract\\_id=3586555](https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fpapers.ssrn.com%2Fsol3%2Fpapers.cfm%3Fabstract_id%3D3586555%26fbclid%3DIwAR1brtmxa4opz_GVDZxLhZ0feDQnaru7VJY3E9Kzh0pSzwgzi3u31j23p6Q&h=AT3-bP_LhT2nBx5wrqnxNmGIcps_-OZUu_HSrrK54zQOnX6oQt5CzkpifMkKUh1oxGE2C8hJSBelEal04141qVRgiEgyQVx4O25wyOrrOKax6YJU0H_DykISuI3sgihGUcZtaGOOKJDP2_A8hnzD&__tn__=-UK-R&c[0]=AT285vFGWJ6ZoR63f7JxsRf-e5BlsHTNEwZRLyt1Vjb4Y-FFEqli5m2HrT057u3hrtYhBdLIobnCAF3oQDuE3lb_fFAnPYS8Y6iVFBOCJh_FEsy3OINe8QcTt5TWPQLq-Uxfc7Ei)\n\nNote : Please do your own research and talk to your doctor before taking any supplements!

A drug of Nobel Prize-honored distinction, IVM has been safely distributed in 3.7 billion doses worldwide since 1987. It has exhibited major, statistically significant reductions in case mortality and severity in 11 clinical trials for COVID-19, three with randomized controls. The indicated biological mechanism of IVM is the same as that of antiviral antibodies generated by vaccines\u2014binding to SARS-CoV-2 viral spike protein, blocking viral attachment to host cells.\n\nMass distributions of IVM for COVID-19 treatments, inpatient and outpatient, were conducted in different timeframes with local autonomy in the 25 states (departamentos) of Peru. These treatments were conducted early in the pandemic\u2019s first wave in 24 states, in some cases beginning even a few weeks before the May 8 national authorization, but delayed four months in Lima. Analysis was performed using Peruvian public health data for all-cause deaths and for COVID-19 case fatalities, as independently tracked for ages 60 and above. These daily figures were retrieved and analyzed by state. Case incidence data were not analyzed due to variations in testing methods and other confounding factors. These clinical data associated with IVM treatments beginning in different time periods, April through August 2020, in each of 25 Peruvian states, spanning an area equivalent to that from Denmark to Italy and Greece in Europe or from north to south along the US, with a total population of 33 million, provided a rich source for analysis.\n\nFor the 24 states with early IVM treatment (and Lima), excess deaths dropped 59% (25%) at +30 days and 75% (25%) at +45 days after day of peak deaths. Case fatalities likewise dropped sharply in all states but Lima, yet six indices of Google-tracked community mobility rose over the same period. For nine states having mass distributions of IVM in a short timeframe through a national program, Mega-Operaci\u00f3n Tayta (MOT), excess deaths at +30 days dropped by a population-weighted mean of 74%, each drop beginning within 11 day after MOT start. Extraneous causes of mortality reductions were ruled out. These sharp major reductions in COVID-19 mortality following IVM treatment thus occurred in each of Peru\u2019s states, with such especially sharp reductions in close time conjunction with IVM treatments in each of the nine states of operation MOT. Its safety well established even at high doses, IVM is a compelling option for immediate, large scale national deployments as an interim measure and complement to pandemic control through vaccinations.\n\n\nNote: Funding: This paper received no funding. \n\nDeclaration of Interests: None of the three authors of this paper have any competing interest, no financial interests at all, relevant to the subject or conclusions of this paper.", "sentiment": 0.5423}, {"id": "glbgk5q", "author": "GallantIce", "parent_id": "l8a93d", "content": "Coincidence? \nWithout solid large RCTs we don\u2019t know.", "sentiment": -0.1139}, {"id": "glc9nbi", "author": "jdorje", "parent_id": "glbgz1q", "content": "That's not how confounding factors work.

I was unable to find the CDC's definition of \"New York City,\" so for this analysis I am assuming it's New York, Kings, Bronx, Richmond, and Queens Counties.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Summary Data:**\n\n|Gender|Ten-Year Age Groups|2020|Median 2014-2018|2020 % of median|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|Female|15-24|39|36|109.86%|\n||25-34|142|66|215.15%|\n||35-44|255|135|189.59%|\n||45-54|600|370|162.38%|\n||55-64|1522|706|215.73%|\n||65-74|2693|1085|248.20%|\n||75-84|3788|1614|234.77%|\n||85+|6401|3001|213.33%|\n||Female Total|15440|6946|222.30%|\n||||||\n|Male|15-24|102|91|112.09%|\n||25-34|297|161|184.47%|\n||35-44|621|231|268.83%|\n||45-54|1366|545|250.64%|\n||55-64|2964|1079|274.70%|\n||65-74|4259|1370|310.99%|\n||75-84|4516|1578|286.19%|\n||85+|3979|1648|241.44%|\n||Male Total|18104|6643|272.53%\u200b|\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Data By Year:**\n\n|Gender|Ten-Year Age Groups|2014|2015|2016|2017|2018|2020|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|Female|15-24|36|36|35|26|19|39|\n||25-34|63|68|70|64|64|142|\n||35-44|148|132|137|130|127|255|\n||45-54|376|375|364|342|313|600|\n||55-64|708|679|744|691|703|1522|\n||65-74|983|1067|1073|1097|1109|2693|\n||75-84|1561|1597|1630|1559|1680|3788|\n||85+|3034|3167|2839|2872|2967|6401|\n||Female Total|6909|7121|6892|6781|6982|15440|\n|||||||||\n|Male|15-24|90|92|92|78|65|102|\n||25-34|136|153|192|146|169|297|\n||35-44|232|223|258|224|230|621|\n||45-54|592|555|535|523|516|1366|\n||55-64|1113|1037|1090|1053|1068|2964|\n||65-74|1287|1385|1465|1261|1354|4259|\n||75-84|1461|1592|1580|1517|1576|4516|\n||85+|1564|1657|1655|1641|1614|3979|\n||Male Total|6475|6694|6867|6443|6592|18104|\n\n**How I got there:**\n\nIt's tough to get up-to-date age binned mortality data from the CDC as a member of the general public.

Sweden, meanwhile, will probably be close enough to herd immunity that cases will have dropped off considerably, life will be returning to normal and the economic bleeding will have been stopped (or at least slowed). \n\nYou mention South Korea, but then accurately note the cultural and political challenges that would prevent other countries from implementing a similar strategy. I think that is true in both the U.S. and Europe to varying degrees, and why their approach probably won't work on either side of the Atlantic. It would be nice, but it's likely far too late in the game, as cases are too widespread relative to population size. Even if they tried, it is a surgical approach that Western governments and cultures seem incapable of carrying out effectively.

Sample sizes are too small to attach a tight confidence window to that 1/90,000 CFR, and it's possible risk is variable by age even in under-18s.

It represents an individual mortality cost (using a low-end $5M value of life for healthy UK kids) of slightly over $50 per positive test.  The UK has R~1, so each of these infections has lead to one more infection on average; using a 0.1% IFR for the whole country (with only $2M value of life for the average death) that secondary infection averages $2,000 in mortality costs.
