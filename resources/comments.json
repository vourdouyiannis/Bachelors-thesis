So I\u2019m guessing this mostly comes down to it being hard for us to shake the idea of germs on surfaces being our enemy. Burger King, for example isn\u2019t requiring masks because they\u2019re so worried about the science of spreading through food, they do that because masks lower person to person spread and because they want to show the public they\u2019re safe. \n\nIf the virus spread through food, I think that would be pretty easy to know at this point. That we don\u2019t have evidence of it, but we know so much about how and where the virus is spread is practically unbelievable without some specific evidence to the contrary.\n\nWhether it spreads through food or not isn\u2019t a minor issue either so without knowing the specifics of every test, it\u2019s also hard to believe there is some lack of attention being paid to this. Spread among food workers and people who visit food places of various settings seems easy enough to explain with contact between maskless people indoors.", "polarity": "-"}, {"id": "gbxoqgg", "author": "zx2000n", "parent_id": "gbxbpnq", "content": "It looks like it is not happen predominantly.\nFor a lung disease, the most efficient route for sure is aerosol.\nOtherwise, it has to go through the heavily guarded blood or by multiplying in the upper airways and then go down using locally created aerosol, for example in the vocal cords.", "polarity": "+"}, {"id": "gc0pe0c", "author": "afk05", "parent_id": "gbxoqgg", "content": "Is this also true for mouth breathers, and those with sleep apnea, restricted airways and underdeveloped jaws?

So far the research I\u2019ve found, and been provided in this thread, leads me to believe there have been decades of work on coronavirus vaccines- and the best we have are questionable animal vaccines (livestock can also catch coronaviruses) with low effectiveness and mortality rates much higher than the risk of catching covid-19.  \n\nEssentially I don\u2019t hold out hope that a vaccine will end this thing.

It ended up as a bit of a wall.  But basically I tried to give some examples of vaccines and the way they work and the reason why what you're saying will not be done.  I'm not offended if you don't read the entire thing.\n\n----\n\nI just think you're a bit confused.  You can't make a vaccine for all coronaviruses.  Coronaviruses are a category of numerous viruses.  We have a coronavirus vaccine for livestock, but it is for one singular coronavirus.  They can still catch other coronaviruses.  That just isn't how vaccines work.  You cannot make a singular vaccine that works against every single virus of a specific class.  Vaccines do not and will never (during our lifetime) work that way.  The way vaccines work is by creating a specific antibody response to a specific pathogen.  Antibodies are specific to a disease, not generic.  Vaccines cannot work broadly, as they would not be trigger a specific antibody response to a specific pathogen otherwise.\n\nI'll use bacteria for an example, since I'm more familiar with naming conventions and certain vaccines.  Neisseria is a genus of bacteria, meaning it's a category of bacteria with relatively similar characteristics, thought to be genetically more related to one another rather than those in the Candida genus, for example.  There are numerous types of Neisseria bacteria.  Among the most significant in huamans are Neisseria gonorrheae (causes the STD gonorrhea) and Neisseria meningitidis (causes a severe, rapidly fatal, and highly contagious meningitis).\n\nCurrently, we have a N. meningitidis vaccine, but vaccines are specific.  It does not and will never affect the other genus of Neisseria, as the bacteria in this genus are too genetically distinct to be affected by a vaccine.  So getting an N meningitidis vaccine has zero affect on your ability to contract N gonorrheae (gonorrhea).  Because again, vaccines do not work broadly.  They are too genetically distinct.  That goes against the very nature of what it means to be a vaccine and how antibodies work.\n\nEven among N meningitidis, there are multiple subtypes of the bacteria, as there often are with any pathogen.  We have vaccines against some of the most common subtypes.  But being vaccinated with subtype A only gives you **zero** protection against subtype B.  Antibodies are a highly highly specific immune response and, even among the same genus, there are too many genetic variations to just have a singular N meningitidis vaccine that works against all types.  You can combine some of the vaccines into a singular shot, yes, but that's not the point.  All of these vaccines needed to be developed separately, even if they are able to combine a few of them physically in the same test tube in the end.\n\nLet's look at another example...HPV (human papilloma virus).  HPV is virtually ubiquitous in humans.  But certain subtypes are known to cause certain types of cancers like cervical cancers.  We currently have a vaccine against some of the subtypes of HPV that cause the greatest incidence of cancer.  But they do not and will never protect against all HPV subtypes.  There are just too many and there is less of a real reason to do so.  Even with the HPV vaccines we have, they had to individually research and create each one.  But again, being vaccinated only against say, HPV type 16, does not give you any protection whatsoever against HPV type 8, for example.  Even if ultimately, you are able to put the HPV 16 and HPV 8 vaccines in the same syringe, it doesn't change the fact that each had to individually be developed.  And no, we will never have a vaccination against all HPV forms.  It just isn't feasible or necessary.\n\nThen you get things like the influenza vaccine, which has to be altered slightly each year because of how frequently and readily the virus mutates.  If SARS-CoV-2 will behave similarly, there will be issues in creating a singular vaccine that will work for more than one year at a time.\n\nAnd then you have certain diseases where our bodies are just unable to maintain a significant immune response for a period of time for whatever reason.  Take rabies, for example.  Rabies is a 99.999999% fatal disease if you catch it.  But, we actually have a vaccine against it!  But the immune response to the vaccine only lasts maybe a year at a time for humans.  So in order to remain immune to the virus, you'd need a yearly vaccine.  We've found that for the general population, this is just far too costly and not really feasible or necessary.  Instead, we've found that it works better to vaccinate our pets (who are more likely to be in contact with animal carriers) and those traveling to endemic areas.\n\nThen, you have some diseases where, unfortunately, we just aren't able to generate that strong of an immune response from the vaccine for some reason.  Some countries vaccinate against Mycobacterium tuberculosis, which causes TB.  Weirdly enough, the vaccine does not give total immunity to the disease, and flat out just doesn't seem to work in adults for some reason.\n\nVery very rarely, catching a certain disease provides cross immunity to another disease, but again, it's very very uncommon.  There was a really popular example people use when talking about this, but unfortunately it escapes my memory, sorry.  But typically, it only offers limited protection instead of 100% immunity anyway.  We know that it doesn't work this way for the entire class of coronaviruses though, as people who have had other forms of coronavirus (colds) are still able to contract COVID-19.\n\nFortunately, for people at risk of pneumonia, there actually is a pneumonia vaccine that covers some of the most common causes of pneumonia, but it can never protect against all forms unfortunately, and you do have to periodically get it again.\n\nSo as you see, vaccines are far more complicated than \"just create a vaccine for every single coronavirus/the category of coronaviruses\".\n\nAnyway, hope this helps a bit.", "polarity": "+"}, {"id": "fof3gq3", "author": "scionkia", "parent_id": "foe7zt3", "content": "Well spoken.

But this is a personal opinion.\nSo, let's say that I'm skeptical about human nature in general and about the specific ambitions of pharma companies, universities and governments. I prefer not to develop this too much as we would fall into politics and other considerations (and it would be a different debate itself), but this is mostly my point.\n\nI'm not specifically concerned about this kind of measures being taken under such an urgent situation like the current one, but the fact that these practices can start to be just assumed with not enough debate and that they might last even when this situation is more controlled.\nThe urgency of the situation demand to be flexible and adapt (and researchers are already doing this worldwide: the timelines have very little to do -much quicker- than any previous one and sharing preprints e.g. was not extended in Medicine until this), but we shouldn't miss the point that long-term decisions and standards should be discussed quietly and urgency is not the best criteria for more solid and effective projections.\nAnd it's a fact that there have been abuses and bad praxis in the past both in research (in general) as in some pharma companies.\n\nAdditionally, I think that a too focus on a vaccine scope could neglect other aspects of the fight against the virus, that could be useful too and could have long-term benefits both for public health and to be prepared for future scenarios.\nSometimes I have the feeling that there's a lot of pressure to sort this out asap and close it, while this would be a terrible mistake. We have to learn and introduce improvements, not only on the clinical trial methodology, but in many other things. Imo, some people are failing to understand this, as they are not seeing the problem from a scientific perspective, so they might not be able to see the bigger picture.\nThis threat was something that was warned in advance several times and we had previous 'warnings' that seem to have been dismissed. We cannot afford to make the same mistake again. For instance, multi-resistant bacteria is a threat possible much scarier than CoV-SARS-2 and clinicians and researchers have been warning about them since long ago.\nWe need to design ambitious strategies to be better prepared, so IMO, the focus on speed can somehow distort the importance of this.\n\nOn the other hand, I work in clinical research, so I'm quite aware that wrong decisions on this topics could lead to decrease general trust in research and in science and the historical precedents show that this can result on a very long-standing damage to public health in general. So, simplistic approaches tend to trigger my skepticism, as complex problems demand complex solutions.\n\nAs I said, I accept there are other different criterias to mine and there might always be some of level of disagreement, but these issues shouldn't be focused like a soccer game where some people support a team and the other support their adversary.\nDiversity of criteria and points of view can always be constructive and useful to try to achieve scientific consensus.\nI personally support more the approach defended on this article than the ones focused on speed, but I think this is a valid and interesting discussion that ideally should be done rationally and quietly, leaving emotions and sensationalism aside:\nhttps://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-00751-9", "polarity": "+"}, {"id": "frhzmci", "author": "rookinn", "parent_id": "frhgovl", "content": "I\u2019m sick of this comment.

But more than 28 days later all six were healthy**, said Vincent Munster, the researcher who conducted the test.\n\u201cThe rhesus macaque is pretty much the closest thing we have to humans,\u201d Dr. Munster said, noting that scientists were still analyzing the result. He said he expected to share it with other scientists next week and then submit it to a peer-reviewed journal.\nImmunity in monkeys is no guarantee that a vaccine will provide the same degree of protection for humans. A Chinese company that recently started a clinical trial with 144 participants, SinoVac, has also said that its vaccine was effective in rhesus macaques. But with dozens of efforts now underway to find a vaccine, the monkey results are the latest indication that Oxford\u2019s accelerated venture is emerging as a bellwether.*\n\nOf course, we shouldn't take final conclussions from early results in monkey and we should wait for the results in humans.\nBut I personally think that these latest results don't totally match with what it was originally said.\nMarketing is important for clinical trials, as you need to look attractive to get funding and participants, but in my opinion they might have went to far at some stages with this specific trial.\nThere's obviously a lot of pressure and even anxiety to get an effective vaccine asap, but emotions shouldn't be mixed with rationality on these kind of debates.\nAnd the fact of getting downvoted just for expressing that IMO the trial doesn't look as promising as originally sold to the press kinda proves me this point.\n\nI might be totally wrong (i don't dismissed that) but I'm open to be corrected if that's the case.

Contract to popular belief, a vaccine isn't a magical shield. You can still get symptoms when exposed to the virus, it's just much much more mild and for a much shorter duration. So if you expose a few thousand vaccinated young adults to this virus, they can still have mild symptoms, such as a few sniffles, or even a short fever.  This vaccine primes your immune system for a battle--but **that battle still occurs** and hopefully it's over with so quickly that you have no symptoms, or it was just a few sniffles that you thought were allergies.\n\nBut that doesn't tell us anything if upwards of 30% of SARS-CoV-2 infections are already asymptomatic to begin with, and another 50% infections are only very mild in nature. We can't definitively tell whether they recovered quickly because they had the vaccine or just because they're young and healthy. You can even still test positive with an RT-PCR test after being vaccinated. And you can also spread it to other people unknowingly if you were given the virus up your nose and you sneezed on the way home. It's not practical to fully isolate thousands of people for 14-28 days.\n\nThe alternative is to give the challenge to older adults at a large number (N=1000+) where we could truly see if the disease progressed to pneumonia or worse.  The problem here is that if the vaccine doesn't work, then you've just either killed a lot of older people or at best, you've overwhelmed the healthcare system and many other people will die who can't get an ICU bed. The safer and more scientific way is collecting blood plasma and finding neutralizing antibodies which can easily be tested against *in vitro*. That's the money shot, and that can be done without a challenge trial. So far in the Moderna trial, everyone that they've tested so far has developed nAbs that can defeat SARS-CoV-2.

Though better seroprevalence studies have been done, but anyway.\n\nLarge, decently conducted medical trials are rarely that. A drug trial or a vaccine trial will practically _always_ be properly randomized. Now it's certainly within the realms of possibility that they screwed up - and this will be noticed either in peer review, or by the FDA/EMA/etc during approval - this is one of the things they test for. But in general, it's a _completely_ different kind of study than the antibody studies - them randomizing poorly would be completely shocking and ruin the reputations of everyone involved completely.\n\n> . Mild covid can still cause long term complications. Mild and asymptomatic cases are in fact the #1 cause of spread.\n\n1) The primary aim of the vaccines is to prevent severe infection and deaths. This is obviously where they'll have the strongest data; the other data is still promising but less strong, and it's impossible for it to be strong without testing every participant ever weak (which apparently Oxford did in the UK, but won't be doing in the US.) Therefore, even if the vaccine reduced symptoms and did nothing else, they've already done what they want to. But on top of that, participants have to keep weekly medical diaries and get tested - missing mild cases is again unlikely under these conditions.\n\n2) That statement is just misleading at best; the long term complications of covid have been shown to be heavily correlated to the severity of infection. And no, _presymptomatic_ spread is the major threat; those who are completely asymptomatic spread it very very little compared to presymptomatic or those with symptoms [(source)](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/jz87nd/what_the_data_say_about_asymptomatic_covid/). On top of that, studies in fact show that those with more symptoms are likely to spread more.\n\nSo, that's the bottom line - until and unless someone _actually_ finds a flaw in the randomization, which would be extremely unlikely, it's quite unreasonable to think it's not. But you're perfectly free to wait for a peer review or the FDA to confirm it - nobody's getting injected before that. And EVEN IF despite all the protocols it's missing tons of mild cases (and remember, the medical diaries) - then you still succeeded in your primary aim of stopping severe infections and thus hospitalizations and deaths, therefore turning covid into simply another circulating coronavirus.

If it detects viral RNA in the cytosol, it attaches to a receptor on the mitochondria, preventing the mitochondria from transcribing and replicating any more RNA.  This starts an Interferon 1 response.  INF1 is released outside the surface of the infected cell, some are re-bound to receptors on the cell that released it, some bind to neighboring cells, telling them to slow down any replication going on and to encapsulate anything attempting to come into the cells with special markers to destroy.  \n\n1) Some viruses dump their RNA directly into the cell once it makes contact.  Covid19 is double membraned once it enters the cell (think of a membrane around the entire virus, encapsulating the spikes as well), avoiding detection by roaming RIG-1/MDA5 until it splits open near the mitochondria in an effort to gain access to the replicating apparatus inside.  Since the dsRNA is only exposed for a brief period in the cytosol, detection is lowered.\n\n2) covid19 creates a protease that beats the RIG-1 to the mitochondrial receptor telling the RIG-1 \"everything is ok\" and sends the RIG-1 to go self terminate, allowing free replication.  Blocks the interferon 1 cascade.\n\n3) steals the RNA cap from the host cell RNA, essentially making itself recognized as a friend to the cell.\n\n4) MHC I/II - take viral peptides detected in cytosol up to the surface and hold them up like a hand holding an apple, signaling T-cells that \"I am infected with something, please terminate me\".  In contrast, an empty \"hand\" signals to the T-cell everything is fine.  Covid19 blocks MHC I/II from presenting the antigen.  T-cells eventually recognize that the cell doesnt have as many MHC I/II on the surface as it should have and terminates the cell.\n\n5) since covid19 is almost entirely made of ACE spikes, monocytes in the extracellular space dont recognize it as a threat since other reactions in the body use those same shaped proteins.  \n\nAll the retro viruses have complex innate immune system evasion techniques.

The [study you cite most frequently](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32196678) looks at 11 cases.

He hasn't had an asthma attack since childhood, while I've been battling asthma-related chronic bronchitis for the past 10 years.

It's much easier to identify e.g. obesity, or even heart disease, based on autopsy or physical appearance and blood work.

All excess mortality is in the 65+ year group - every other age group is below average excess mortality.

That would be my best guess in absence of any other data point. You are unable to convincingly explain why the hospitals are being overrun worse than in any other recent flu season even when excess mortality is down as you pointed out.\n\nAll you have provided are anecdotes without any data and your claim is that the deaths in Italy are largely the result of the measures taken by the government to prevent COVID-19 from spreading and not CPOVID-19 itself. However the vast majority of the epidemiological data shows that not to be true  as COVID-19 patients did require more use of vents and ICU beds than ever before and the rate of increase in infection has nothing to do with any of the anecdotes you mentioned. \n\n> \u201eIn recent weeks, most of the Eastern European nurses who worked 24 hours a day, 7 days a week supporting people in need of care in Italy have left the country in a hurry. This is not least because of the panic-mongering and the curfews and border closures threatened by the \u201eemergency governments\u201c. As a result, old people in need of care and disabled people, some without relatives, were left helpless by their carers.\n\nYou will need to provide hard data and evidence for this being the cause of increased deaths or the near collapse of Italian hospitals.

Chronic disease epidemiology was my jam, but I work in oncology now. \n\nLosing weight is by far the best thing to be doing right now, so keep it up! I forget the exact numbers now but it's something like every 5% of weight you lose will drop your blood pressure by some points - sorry I forget the details but it's very easy to see charted out. So that's the big priority for sure.\n\nFor the rest of the class we'd focus on diet, exercise, and sleep/stress relief. Look up the DASH diet which has recommendations for diet changes beneficial to blood pressure. High level summary - watch your intake of processed/boxed food items, get lots of colorful fruit and veg, high fiber intake, etc. The stuff we've all been told before. I will say DASH recommends a higher carb intake than I personally eat (I'm not low carb by any means, we just don't eat stuff like pasta much), so feel free to tweak it with either a little more in protein or swap some carbs with some EVOO which is quite delicious. Fatty fish is great, nuts and seeds are good snacks but easy to overeat so just watch the calories. \n\nNext is exercise, but don't feel the need to overdo it. The AHA recommends 150 minutes of moderate activity a week - this can be as easy as going for a walk, gardening, cleaning your house! Take a 20 minute walk after dinner every day and you're at 140 minutes right there.\n\nFinally, work on your sleep habits. Have a routine before bed, get your 7-8 hours a night. Avoid caffeine too late in the evening. No screens before bed. And if you are someone prone to stress I highly recommend doing a few minutes of meditation or body scans a day. Stress and blood pressure go hand in hand. I would have participants take their BP, do a 5-10 minute meditation, then take it again and their score would drop a lot.

Public health measures that can reduce the risk of infection and death in addition to quarantines are desperately needed. This article reviews the roles of vitamin D in reducing the risk of respiratory tract infections, knowledge about the epidemiology of influenza and COVID-19, and how vitamin D supplementation might be a useful measure to reduce risk. Through several mechanisms, vitamin D can reduce risk of infections. Those mechanisms include inducing cathelicidins and defensins that can lower viral replication rates and reducing concentrations of pro-inflammatory cytokines that produce the inflammation that injures the lining of the lungs, leading to pneumonia, as well as increasing concentrations of anti-inflammatory cytokines. Several observational studies and clinical trials reported that vitamin D supplementation reduced the risk of influenza, whereas others did not. Evidence supporting the role of vitamin D in reducing risk of COVID-19 includes that the outbreak occurred in winter, a time when 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) concentrations are lowest; that the number of cases in the Southern Hemisphere near the end of summer are low; that vitamin D deficiency has been found to contribute to acute respiratory distress syndrome; and that case-fatality rates increase with age and with chronic disease comorbidity, both of which are associated with lower 25(OH)D concentration. To reduce the risk of infection, it is recommended that people at risk of influenza and/or COVID-19 consider taking 10,000 IU/d of vitamin D3 for a few weeks to rapidly raise 25(OH)D concentrations, followed by 5000 IU/d. The goal should be to raise 25(OH)D concentrations above 40-60 ng/mL (100-150 nmol/L). For treatment of people who become infected with COVID-19, higher vitamin D3 doses might be useful.

IPD were obtained for 10\u2009933 (96.6%) participants. Vitamin D supplementation reduced the risk of acute respiratory tract infection among all participants (adjusted odds ratio 0.88, 95% confidence interval 0.81 to 0.96; P for heterogeneity <0.001). In subgroup analysis, protective effects were seen in those receiving daily or weekly vitamin D without additional bolus doses (adjusted odds ratio 0.81, 0.72 to 0.91) but not in those receiving one or more bolus doses (adjusted odds ratio 0.97, 0.86 to 1.10; P for interaction=0.05). Among those receiving daily or weekly vitamin D, protective effects were stronger in those with baseline 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels <25 nmol/L (adjusted odds ratio 0.30, 0.17 to 0.53) than in those with baseline 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels \u226525 nmol/L (adjusted odds ratio 0.75, 0.60 to 0.95; P for interaction=0.006). Vitamin D did not influence the proportion of participants experiencing at least one serious adverse event (adjusted odds ratio 0.98, 0.80 to 1.20, P=0.83). The body of evidence contributing to these analyses was assessed as being of high quality.\n\n**Conclusions**\u00a0Vitamin D supplementation was safe and it protected against acute respiratory tract infection overall.

I had moved to a different city and so my doctor on evaluation was happy with the progress . I told him I had never gotten any maintenance doses but at this point with my levels, he said I din't need any. I was okay with that because I didn't need overdosage either. My aches and pains were gone for a whole 9 months at this point and I was at least 50% less tired than before. I was given a Vitamin B12 supplement for 3 months at this point. All was good again!\n\nIn December 2019, I was evaluated again. I had moved to a third city at this point. The levels were 34. The third doctor said I didn't need any supplementation at this point.

From the Broward PDF:\n\n> Severity of pulmonary involvement was assessed at the time of initiation of therapy (\u201conset\u201d) and categorized as severe or non-severe. \n\n> Patients were considered to have severe pulmonary involvement if they required an FiO2 of 50% or greater, high-flow nasal oxygen, noninvasive ventilation, or intubation and mechanical ventilation. \n\n> The non-severe pulmonary criteria encompassed patients who required no supplemental oxygen, or \u201clow FIO2\u201d (ie: Venturi mask 40% or less, or any amount of low flow nasal cannula), independent of radiographic or laboratory findings.\n\nFor IVM, *some* of the \"severe\" patients were on ventilators, but others weren't. For DEX, the less-severe group is \"patients needing oxygen\", versus two categories for IVM, \"high-flow\" (severe) and \"low FI02\" (not severe). For IVM, the less-severe group includes patients that do *not* need *any* oxygen supplementation.\n\nMaybe both DEX groups can be merged into one comparable to the IVM severe group? How do we merge the DEX results, though, without knowing how many patients were in each of the DEX groups?!\n\nAnother factor is how the Broward fatality rate is so high compared to the DEX study: the with-IVM fatality rate (38.8%) is about the same as the without-DEX fatality rate (40%), the latter for patients on *ventilators*. The without-IVM Broward fatality rate was 80.7%!!! \n\nAre the Broward patients a lot older? Broward *is* in southern Florida, retirement heaven. Given the mean age 59.6 years and standard deviation 17.9, if a normal curve is applicable (doubtful) then the Broward age distribution looks like [this](https://i.imgur.com/vrEWS8W.png).\n\n<time lapse>\n\nI can't find any details about the subjects of this study, so I can't speculate about age differences between the two studies.\n\nReaching for a conclusion:\n\nThrough my ivermectin-colored glasses, ivermectin seems superior given:  \n\n1) IVM's 52% lower mortality rate for the most severe patients (80.7% -> 38.8%) vs the 30% reduction for DEX's ventilator group (40% -> 28%).  \n\n2) Despite the \"not severe\" Broward group probably being healthier, esp. some do not require any oxygen supplementation (at intake), the overall Broward mortality rate dropped 40% (25.2% -> 15.0%) which is better than DEX's strongest result, the 30% drop for ventilator patients.  \n \n3) For DEX's healthier (no ventilator) patients, the rate dropped only 20% (25% -> 20%) -- *half* of the overall Broward result (40%) which included severe and non-severe patients.  \n\nTrying for the overall DEX mortality, if we assume that DEX had 5 times as many non-ventilator patients as ventilator patients, then this might calculate the weighted change in mortality:\n\n(5/6 * (20 / 25)) + (1/6 * (28 / 40)) = .783\n\nmeaning DEX reduced the overall fatality rate by 21.7% -- just over *half* of the overall IVM reduction (40%).\n\nIs my math correct? I got 800 on the math GRE -- in 1977. The little gray cells do not work as well as they used to.\n\nWhat do you think? Did ivermectin show stronger results in the Broward study?

I mean, even after treatment with ivermectin, the fatality rate barely reached that of the control group in the dexamethasone study.\n\nSo until there are studies on a comparable cohort in a similar location, I think it is difficult to make direct comparisons.\n\nIf the patients and standard-of-care provided are truly comparable, then that would lead us to believe that treatment with dexamethasone led to a mortality rate of 28% compared to 39% with ivermectin. Which would make dexamethasone superior. But again, these sorts of direct comparisons are baseless.\n\nAssuming the cohorts are not comparable between studies, and the Dexamethasone study location has a better standard-of-care and therefore lower base fatality rate, then the smaller absolute reduction in mortality by finding an effective treatment is obviously expected. If dexamethasone on its own brings mortality down to 20%, then whether you start at an 80% or 40% mortality rate is going to make it more or less impressive.\n\nIf I begin with an 80% base mortality rate, and give those patients dexamethasone instead of ivermectin, who's to say that the mortality wouldn't go even lower than the 39% observed for ivermectin?\n\nThis isn't to say that dexamethasone is superior to ivermectin.

I dropped a few references below (because I can recall them extemporaneously.) that show how the literature doesn't point clearly toward efficacy.   It'll take me a little longer to track down COVID-19 specific literature. (I've read a good deal of it, but haven't had a chance to organize what I've read.). \n\nFor the record, I do think glucocorticoids have a role in treatment of COVID-19 (and probably sepsis and ARDS), however they are powerful, but fairly crude tools with nasty adverse effect profiles. How glucocorticoids (and dexamethasone specifically) are used probably matters. I'm sympathetic to pulse treatment, stopping when it appears that the inflammatory response is calming. (Measured by reduced O2 requirement, possibly D-dimer/CRP/ESR etc.) However, injudicious use is likely to cause harm (which my read of the RCT data of parallel clinical problems (sepsis/ARDS) suggests.) \n\n>Can you source that too? Glucocorticoids are used quite widely in ICU in my experience.\n\nThe ATS reading list has a few links that may help clarify.(Note: This is by no means exhaustive, just illustrative.)\n\n For instance:\n\nhttps://www.thoracic.org/professionals/career-development/residents-medical-students/ats-reading-list/adult/\n\n**In ARDS:**\nSteinberg KP, Hudson LD, Goodman RB, et al. Efficacy and safety of corticosteroids for persistent acute respiratory distress syndrome. N Engl J Med 2006; 354:1671-84. This study randomized 180 patients with persistent ARDS (7 to 28 days after onset) to methylprednisolone (daily dose 2 mg/kg x 14 days then 1 mg/kg x 7 days) vs. placebo. **Hospital mortality and 180-day survival were comparable, but patients enrolled 14 or more days after ARDS onset had increased 60-day mortality (35% vs. 8% placebo, p = .02).**\n\nMeduri GU, Golden E, Freire AX, et al. Methylprednisolone infusion in early severe ARDS: results of a randomized controlled trial. Chest 2007; 131:954-63. This study of 91 patients with severe ARDS added fuel to the debate over systemic corticosteroid use in ARDS. The intervention group received steroids within 72 hours of ARDS diagnosis and a slow taper. **Steroid recipients had decreased duration of mechanical ventilation and ICU stay.** The higher proportion of patients with catecholamine-dependent shock among controls, cross over from control to steroids in \u201cnonresponders\u201d at day 7, and 2:1 randomization of treatment to control are among the concerns raised since its publication.\n\n**In Sepsis**\n\nVenkatesh B, Finfer S, Cohen J et al. Adjunctive glucocorticoid therapy in patients with septic shock. N Engl J Med. 2018; 378:797-808. From 2013 - 2017, the ADRENAL trial randomized 3,800 patients with septic shock receiving mechanical ventilation to receive hydrocortisone (at a dose of 200 mg per day via continuous infusion) or placebo for 7 days or until death or ICU discharge. **There was no difference in 90-day mortality (near 28% for both groups). The steroid group spent less time on vasopressors but duration of ICU stay and days free of mechanical ventilation did not differ.**\n\n>this pretty much outranks any other data we have on the matter.\n\nI'd like to push back epistemically against the idea that RCTs \"outrank\" other forms of knowledge.\n\nRCTs have a number of useful features: Randomization is a hedge against confounding so they have good internal validity. The problem is their external validity is generally not as good because they tend to be small, study specific populations (that may be heterogenous), and ask fairly narrow questions. In my opinion, extrapolation to different populations and similar, but not identical clinical questions must be done thoughtfully, incorporating other trial data, cohort data, and physiology. \n\nIf your patient population doesn't look like the study's population the study results may not be applicable. Similarly, if both the intervention and placebo group's care differs from usual care in one's own institution, it's hard to know if the effect is a result of the the intervention, an interaction with the difference in care and the intervention or an inappropriate control group. \n\n(This is my initial concern with this papers result. Neither the statistical data I've seen, nor my own clinical experience suggests that 13% of hospitalized COVID-19 patients without an O2 requirement die. I haven't witnessed anything that approaches this. (None of my own patients without an O2 requirement have died, for instance.) Why is this happening to the control group of this trial? \n\nAnother challenge concerns heterogenous study populations (like this one). It's not clear if a small subpopulation is enjoying a large effect size or the whole population is enjoying a smaller one. Sometimes, subgroup analysis can clarify this, but this presumes that the authors frame their question correctly and aren't missing an unconsidered parameter.\n\nIn short, RCTs are great, but need to be interpreted in the setting of what we already know. They should update our prior odds, but not reset them.\n\n\nEdit: \nA source defending that 13% mortality is surprisingly high for COVID-19 patients that do not require respiratory support: \n\n(https://www.mayoclinicproceedings.org/article/S0025-6196(20)30367-0/pdf) \" Thirty-five of 51 patients (68.63%) with SpO2 values of 90% or less after oxygen supplementation did not survive, whereas 88 of 89 (98.9%) of those with SpO2 values greater than 90% did survive (log-rank P<.001)\"\n\n\nSupport for the statement that the adverse effects of glucocorticoids can increase mortality of ICU patients: (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22732293/)\n\n\" systemic corticosteroids should be used very cautiously because this treatment is strongly associated with increased risk of death in patients with intensive care unit-acquired pneumonia, particularly in the absence of established indications and in patients with lower baseline severity. \"", "polarity": "+"}, {"id": "fv0ocrs", "author": "DNAhelicase", "parent_id": "fv0b3up", "content": "Your comment is unsourced speculation [Rule 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/about/rules/).

Also an interesting note, his APLS cut his 1st prosthetic valve's life in half. Two leaflets were fixed in place with no motion with another one completely missing because of APLS. Because lovenox doesn't do swell with metal valves and he's at high risk, he's back on warfarin with a target INR between 3-3.5, plavix and aspirin. No DOACSs. He's supposed to have his factor x tested to tell when his PTINR is a false read but his new hematologist doesn't \"believe in it\".  No clots that we know of so far.

Gorelik believes the cases are not Kawasaki disease but a similar condition that shares a common cause, namely an infectious agent that triggers an immune response.The three New York cases follow a report from Stanford University in California, in which a 6-month-old was admitted to hospital with Kawasaki disease and was later diagnosed with coronavirus.\n\nMany of the children having treatment for the new syndrome have tested positive for coronavirus, but others have not.

As you get more clotting you increase the risk of clumps of platelets breaking off and floating in the blood stream, these will either be broken down by the body or can get stuck somewhere else.  If a few of these combined and get big enough that larger clump could get stuck somewhere important causing a stroke, heart attack etc  that kills you.  This would explain why we are seeing tons of \"mini-clot\" throughout the lungs, some of these break off and then its a bit of a luck game if your body breaks it down or if it grows and blocks something important. \n\n\nthe source that u/dadealeus provides argues something kinda similar.  He argues that as part of the immune response to COVID the body is releasing histamine.  Histamine is normal, but in allergies you have too much of it and that causes problems.  So as the pneumonia progresses you get histamine release and a lack of oxygen caused by the pnemonia (this isn't the histamine causing the lack of oxygen like it would in a severe peanut allergy).  He argues that these 2 factors cause a net over-release of a clotting factor (or technically, its corresponding anti-coagulant gets \"exhausted\" first, your body stops releasing is sooner than it release the clotting factor).  So you have an increase in the clotting factor in your blood, which causes platelets to start adhering to each other and that causes the clots we are seeing.  There's a few jumps in there that I had issues with but I don't know enough to just say no so I'm still looking through the literature a bit to see if all those make sense.\n\nThe problem I have with both of these is that anecdotally our measures of clotting seem to be higher in covid patients than other pneumonia patients.  So to me it feels like both of these explanations don't explain why COVID specifically is causing this (yes the youtube video makes the HP argument but doesn't explain why covid is unique).  Of course it could be we aren't used to seeing this many pneumonia patients and the prevalence isn't actually higher it just seems to be because there are so many more cases we are seeing.", "polarity": "-"}, {"id": "fp9tj45", "author": "marsloversonearth", "parent_id": "fp9nkzg", "content": "Interesting!

There has been an outbreak of \"lycan disease\" and people are turning into hairy beasts full of rage. What's the first first thing that everyone reaches for? [Silver bullets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver_bullet) because although it's expensive and a very niche solution, it's is effective against werewolf like creatures. \n\nBut somewhere along the way, we make a discovery. From a few observations:\n\n* Jane and Thomas were walking back from the orchard and encountered a werewolf and somehow it didn't attack them. \n* Ol' Betty Sue was baking a pie and a werewolf that entered her house left without killing her.\n* Mysteriously, no teachers in the city have been killed.\n\nSo someone starts to wonder what these all have in common. And an insightful physician says, \"they were all eating apples!\". And so the villagers' physicians come up with a (horrific) test: Let's give the *some* of the orphans in Saint Anne's School apples with every meal and allow them to play outside; and let's give some of the orphans tarts instead. To be semi-random, orphans born in even years get apples and the ones born in odd years get tarts. No trading allowed!\n\nSo the study began, but while it was ongoing, the smith and the jeweler kept on supplying silver bullets to the villagers!\n\nWell, after four weeks, the physicians check the experiment's progress. They discover that zero orphans in the apple eating group were killed, and only one was maimed though not turned. And 8 in the tart eating group were killed and another 5 were infected with lycan disease. \n\nThe hypothesis has been validated: An apple a day keeps the werewolves away!\n\nOf course, there are a few cynical and conspiratorial villagers in the bunch. They ask aloud, \"Why were *silver bullets* pushed back in the beginning!? Everyone knows *an apple a day* is the answer!\" Others among them suggest that it's the village jeweler and smith conspiring to profiteer off of the outbreak of lycan disease. It seems so obvious...\n\nBut again, turning to the record, we are reminded that no one knew that eating apples prevented one from being attacked by werewolves. They're conflating the adage of \"an apple a day keeps the doctor away\" and the general idea that apples are good and healthy with the specific fact established by recent observations and experiments that apples have a specific effect in preventing lycan disease.\n\nBut because everyone's under a lot of stress with the whole werewolf thing, and people are looking for targets to blame... it's somehow easier to believe that the jeweler and the smith, who really were just trying to help, somehow were suppressing a better alternative. But the truth is that the villagers had no alternative! And even long after the apple news was discovered, the town still needed to keep a stock of silver bullets because they were effective!\n\n***", "polarity": "-"}, {"id": "ge54kze", "author": "darknessdown", "parent_id": "ge51kh2", "content": "Woah that was simultaneously really impressive and more than a little off putting", "polarity": "+"}, {"id": "ge52cqx", "author": "MurphysLab", "parent_id": "ge51kh2", "content": "## Back to COVID Science\n\nSo, let's get back to COVID-19 now. At the beginning of the pandemic, no one had any clue that vitamin D was playing such a big role in modulating the effects of the disease on individuals. \n\nWhen you are faced with some new, partially unknown problem, you start with solutions to similar problems. In this case, we know that COVID-19 is a (corona)virus, so for *severe* cases, you treat them with a [**broad-spectrum antiviral drug**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broad-spectrum_antiviral_drug):\n\n> Broad-spectrum antiviral drugs (or broad-spectrum antiviral agents, BSAA) are a class of antiviral drugs, which target and inhibit the replication and development of a broad range of viral pathogens. BSAAs work by inhibiting viral proteins (such as polymerases, proteases, or reverse transcriptases) or by targeting host cell proteins and processes exploited by the virus during infection.\n\n> Many BSAs are found showing efficacy against a given virus outside their original indication, showing antiviral activity against other viruses than originally investigated (such as remdesivir and ritonavir/lopinavir) or outside their original therapeutic indications [...]. This makes BSAs potential candidates for drug repurposing. Repurposing of BSAs will allow for quicker, cheaper and more efficient development of antivirals than de novo drug development.\n\nAnti-viral drugs are targeted at viruses, much as silver bullets are targeted for werewolves. The problem here is that with COVID-19, lots of these broad-spectrum anti-viral drugs weren't working effectively. And that was despite through repeated, *desperate* trying!  Here's an early review from May that looked at a bunch of them:\n\n> Evolving research and clinical data regarding the virologic SARS-CoV-2 suggest a potential list of repurposed drugs with appropriate pharmacological effects and therapeutic efficacies in treating COVID-19 patients. In this review, we will update and summarize the most common and plausible drugs for the treatment of COVID-19 patients. These drugs and therapeutic agents include antiviral agents (remdesivir, hydroxychloroquine, chloroquine, lopinavir, umifenovir, favipiravir, and oseltamivir), and supporting agents (Ascorbic acid, Azithromycin, Corticosteroids, Nitric oxide, IL-6 antagonists), among others. We hope that this review will provide useful and most updated therapeutic drugs to prevent, control, and treat COVID-19 patients until the approval of vaccines and specific drugs targeting SARS-CoV-2.\n\n> An Update on Current Therapeutic Drugs Treating COVID-19, Curr Pharmacol Rep. 2020 May 11 : 1\u201315.\n\n> https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7211915/\n\nRead through that review! At that point, it seemed that the only one that was reported to be effective was  [Remdesivir](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remdesivir). Moreover, subsequent research has *partially* upheld that early finding:\n\n\n> BACKGROUND\n\n> Although several therapeutic agents have been evaluated for the treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19), no antiviral agents have yet been shown to be efficacious.\n\n> CONCLUSIONS\n\n> Our data show that remdesivir was superior to placebo in shortening the time to recovery in adults who were hospitalized with Covid-19 and had evidence of lower respiratory tract infection. \n\n> \"Remdesivir for the Treatment of Covid-19 \u2014 Final Report\", The New England Journal of Medicine, November 5, 2020\n\n> https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2007764\n\nBut that's why remdesivir became the drug of choice. Not because of its price, but because it had early evidence of efficacy when many other treatments did not.\n\n***\n\n**Edit:** I should make clear that remdesivir is no longer the drug of choice, per the World Health Organization, as larger studies have shown a relatively weak effect, if any. The WHO's recommendation was updated recently in light of those studies, in favour of corticosteroid treatments:\n\n\n> **Recommendations:** The panel made a conditional recommendation against the use of remdesivir in hospitalized\npatients with COVID-19, regardless of disease severity. This guidance adds to recommendations published in the\nprevious version: a strong recommendation for systemic corticosteroids in patients with severe and critical COVID19, and a conditional recommendation against systemic corticosteroids in patients with non-severe COVID-19.\n\n> https://apps.who.int/iris/handle/10665/336729 ([PDF](https://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/336729/WHO-2019-nCov-remdesivir-2020.1-eng.pdf))", "polarity": "+"}, {"id": "ge52yq1", "author": "MurphysLab", "parent_id": "ge52cqx", "content": "## What About Vitamin D?\n\nBut along the way as our physicians and scientists are battling this virus, people start looking for trends. And one of those trends was how vitamin D was a big issue. \n\nPerhaps one of the first hints of this issue was the disproportionate effect COVID-19 was having on Black Americans:\n\n\n> In the USA, early data suggest that African Americans are disproportionately affected by COVID-19. In a preliminary study of data compiled from hospitals in 14 US states, African Americans represented 33% of COVID-19 hospitalisations, despite only making up 18% of the total population studied. In another analysis, among COVID-19 deaths for which race and ethnicity data were available, death rates from COVID-19 in New York City (NY, USA) among black or African American people (92\u00b73 deaths per 100 000 population) and Hispanic or Latino people (74\u00b73) were substantially higher than that of white (45\u00b72) or Asian (34\u00b75) people. \u201cStudies are underway to confirm these data and understand and potentially reduce the impact of COVID-19 on the health of racial and ethnic minorities\u201d, a spokesperson from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) confirmed to The Lancet Respiratory Medicine.\n\n> \"Evidence mounts on the disproportionate effect of COVID-19 on ethnic minorities\", *The Lancet Respiratory Medicine*, Published:May 08, 2020\n\n> https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanres/article/PIIS2213-2600(20)30228-9/fulltext \n\nSome of this is certainly a result of socioeconomic disparity, but part of the problem is now understood to involve the inherently lower levels of vitamin D present in individuals with dark skin. (cf. \"[Vitamin D deficiency in African Americans is associated with a high risk of severe disease and mortality by SARS-CoV-2](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41371-020-00398-z)\", Journal of Human Hypertension).\n\nBut that was one of many hints of a trend which pointed physicians to say, \"Hey, we really should study the effect of vitamin D levels on this disease\":\n\n> It is posited by contributors [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] to BMJ, \u2018Preventing a covid-19 pandemic\u2019, others, [6, 7, 8] and myself, [9] that vitamin D, and particularly vitamin D deficiency, is a likely factor in the progression, and/ or severity, and/ or mortality of COVID-19; and also may present clinical treatment opportunities.\n\n> My preprint, \u2018Vitamin D deficiency: a factor in COVID-19, progression, severity and mortality? \u2013 An urgent call for research\u2019, [9] posits, greater vitamin D deficiency <25nmol/L in southern (E.g. Spain and Italy), than northern European Countries (E.g. Germany, Norway, Finland, Iceland), may help account for differentials, in mortality rates per million. Consistent with this, Northern Europeans have higher vitamin D food intakes, food fortification, and supplement more. This is an easily testable posit.\n\n> [...]\n\n> Robert A Brown\n\n> 07 April 2020\n\n> https://www.bmj.com/content/368/bmj.m810/rr-46\n\nSo early on physicians and scientists were seeing hints that vitamin D might be involved, but until the studies *confirmed* that, no one knew. Sure, now it feels like \"Well, everyone knows that vitamin D is good for you... they should have tried it\", but the randomness of those who experienced severe symptoms didn't directly communicate that. And there are thousands of possible factors: To check all of them systematically takes ages. We didn't have ages -- we had people dying. \n\nPlus, you can't just throw the everything and the kitchen sink at the patient while at the same time **learning** something. It's why if you're designing an experiment, you're only allowed to change **one variable** at a time. And with squishy biological systems, outcomes aren't as clear cut, so you need lots of patients (but it's a deadly disease, so you can't intentionally make more atients)... so you can only try a few things at once. Where do you put your money? Where it's most likely to win the bet. In science, that involves having a logical nexus to the problem. i.e. Have virus ---> use an antiviral. You can't go trying lavender oil, *because peoples' lives are at risk!*\n\nAnd yes, even [vitamin C was tested](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7211915/) because the researchers had a reason to suspect it might help:\n\n> [...] ***Given this background,*** a phase II clinical trial (NCT04264533) is initiated in China to evaluate high-dose IV vitamin C in ICU patients with severe COVID-19-associated pneumonia [80]. Some hospitals have reported giving infected patients 1500 mg of vitamin C as supportive treatment. High-dose IV vitamin C has been given in the treatment of 50 moderate to severe COVID-19 patients in China [81]. The doses varied between 2 and 10 g per day, given over a period of 8-\u201310-h IV infusion. [...]\n\nBut as science usually goes, there's a bit of serendipity. Someone, perhaps by chance, notices a pattern and looks further. And from that investigation we can discover a mechanism understand not only what works, but why it works. That helped those on the forefront of science to see that vitamin D played a role. And it wasn't until that connection was made that people knew to act. \n\n***\n\nSo that's the end of my (I hope) informative little rant. It isn't some kind of \"big pharma\" conspiracy. It's science and medicine and pharmacology throwing everything that we have at a novel disease... and then, by luck, find something cheap and effective that happens to reduce the severity of the disease.", "polarity": "+"}, {"id": "ge7d3ij", "author": "Z7N6Qo", "parent_id": "ge52yq1", "content": "This is why I visit this sub..

For opinions we should defer to public health agencies (FDA, CDC, BCCDC, Health Canada, etc...), the WHO, and your physician. But when I want to *become (vaguely) informed* about a technical topic I generally follow the same procedure.\n\n**A word of caution:** Note that this is about becoming *vaguely* informed. Becoming truly informed or expert is not possible for most of us, given the huge backlog of information that one needs to understand. All of us lack the time, if not the ability. And while you might be able to develop a good understanding of the efficacy of a drug, there's so many connections and contradictions and other factors that you are going to miss. That's why even if we have physicians, we have specialties within medicine: oncology for cancer; surgeons for surgery; dermatologists for skin; etc... Deep expertise takes a long time to develop and that is needed as a foundation for being fully informed. \n\nSo this is a guide to becoming *vaguely* informed. \n\n## **Step 1.** Visit Wikipedia\n\nWikipedia usually provides a basic and usually unbiased summary of a topic. I am not turning to Wikipedia to form an opinion, rather just to get a snapshot showing [*the lay of the land*](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/the%20lay%20of%20the%20land). \n\nOne of the biggest challenges for someone who is approaching a new zone of knowledge is vocabulary. We use words to encapsulate ideas, but if you know the idea and not the word, you are generally powerless to learn more. Knowing the right words is like having a key opening the door to more knowledge. So reading a brief Wikipedia article, and perhaps following a few of the links within, will familiarize you with that new vocabulary. \n\nAdditionally, within Wikipedia we find sources - links to primary articles. So it can be good to follow these to examine what the original article actually says. One can provide a link to a source, which gives information a *superficial appearance of support*, but it's necessary to confirm that the source agrees with what it is used to support.\n\n## **Step 2.** Visit Google Scholar\n\nThe link: https://scholar.google.com/\n\nWe want to know about Ivermectin and COVID-19, so we can search that:\n\nOur search: https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=Ivermectin+and+COVID-19\n\nNow, because this is a rapidly evolving area of science and medicine, one needs to be cautious and pay attention to the context of each article. \n\n* Is the article published in a peer-reviewed journal? Be very cautious about non-peer-reviewed publications:\n  * News stories\n  * Press releases\n  * Preprints\n* Where is the article published? \n  * Is it a reputable journal? \n  * Does it have an Impact Factor? \n  * If you aren't sure, try sticking with PubMed - https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=covid-19\n* Who published the article? If it's by professors, they usually have a profile on a university web page. But physicians often don't. \n* Is there a known conflict of interest?\n* What kind of article is this? **Reviews and meta-analysis papers are often the best to go to if you are not an expert!** However they come at a later stage in the overall progress of scientific research. \n  * Study\n  * Meta-Analysis\n  * Review\n  * Letters & Commentary\n* Was the study registered in advance? There should be a statement pointing to clinicaltrials.gov or a similar agency.\n* How is the drug being used? (e.g. prophylaxis / preventative, or treatment of those infected, or for those with severe disease)\n* How large was the study? Bigger studies are less likely to be skewed by random effects. (see: [funnel plots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Funnel_plot))\n* When was the article published? Early articles tend to be more speculative, so again more caution. \n* Look at what's most cited. Again, earlier ones will be cited more often, but given to papers published in the same timeframe, generally more *compelling* ones are cited more frequently. Google Scholar shows rough citation counts, so this can help you to see what has generated the most discussion. Beware of early stuff! \n\nAlso, note that you can click on those citation numbers and get a list of articles cite that paper. This can be very useful to check to see if some promising early result was later confirmed to be effective. \n\nBut it isn't enough to look at just those factors... you have to read the papers.\n\n## **Step 3.** Organize a List of Articles!\n\nOrganize your literature survey. Since this is an area that's happened essentially all within 1 year, a chronological ordering will probably be best, since it allows us to see the genesis of the idea and how perspectives have evolved among experts.\n\n## **Step 4.** Read Several Papers\n\nIdeally, you read several papers, in full. And from those, you can come up with a list of which other papers you should read, because now you have the context of citations. \n\nBut chances are high that you don't have a ton of time. So you skim the papers' content. (Remember: you've already looked at the previously described factors)\n\nSkimming:\n\n1. Read the title. What is the focus?\n2. Read the abstract.

I've done a lot of Steps 1, 3 and 4 over the past 9 months for multiple drugs, but not in an organised manner. I'm a layman and so technically my opinion has no value. \n\nI've followed ivermectin (because cheap and safe, as I live in India where we need cheap and safe as much as effective) since the Monash university in-vitro study, the recanted Lancet observational study paper (Amit Patel et al), the Chaccour debunking of ivermectin claims in the Lancet paper, the subsequent adoption of ivermectin by the Marik protocol, the Broward County Florida study, the dozen or so trials at clinicaltrials.gov (all suffering from small sizes ; not-so-respected / not-well-known universities/hospitals), the repeated success stories from Bangladesh, the studies from Egypt, Iraq, India and the couple of RCTs that seem OK. The question that bothers me is the absence of a large proper RCT in a western country, especially given that ivermectin is not prescribed wholesale to the public like it is in South America and South Asia. Meanwhile, there are very detailed illustrative videos about the mechanism of ivermectin reducing the replication of the virus and helping fight the inflammation response too. Not that I understand much, just that one particular part of the ivermectin molecule blocks the cell mechanism of virus replication once the virus has entered the cell.\n\nGiven all this, I find the lack of interest in conducting a large-scale RCT in western countries surprising. We already have the vaccines by now, so maybe it's not commerically feasible or medically that exciting to do an ivermectin RCT, but given the longevity of the pandemic, it is worth every bit for someone to do a 500+ sized RCT with ivermectin as prophylaxis and mild-stage outpatient intervention at least. If not in the ICU (where observational studies and reports have also shown benefits).\n\nAgain, thank you very much for taking the time to explain all that.

But let me tell you a story.\n> \n> One of my patients ran into the Ambien Walrus the other day and so, make a long story short, she needed a new sleeping pill. She was on a lot of drugs at the time and not all that healthy, and every drug I could think of, the pharmacist had some good reason why that would be a terrible idea in her case.

But because one of the most basic and useful human hormones got completely excluded from medicine just because it didn\u2019t have a drug company to push it.

Given the dynamics of the COVID-19 pandemic, rational vitamin D supplementation whose safety has been proven in an extensive body of research should be promoted and initiated to limit the toll of the pandemic even before the final proof of efficacy in preventing COVID-19 deaths by randomized trials.\n> \n> We read, with great interest, the recent article by Radujkovic et al. that reported associations between vitamin D deficiency (25(OH)D < 12 ng/mL) or insufficiency (25(OH)D < 20 ng/mL) and death in a cohort of 185 consecutive symptomatic SARS-CoV-2-positive patients admitted to the Medical University Hospital Heidelberg, who were diagnosed and treated between 18 March and 18 June 2020 [[1](https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/12/12/3642/htm#B1-nutrients-12-03642)]. In this cohort, 118 patients (64%) had vitamin D insufficiency at recruitment (including 41 patients with vitamin D deficiency), and 16 patients died of the infection. With a covariate-adjusted relative risk of death of 11.3, mortality was much higher among vitamin D insufficient patients than among other patients. When translated to the proportion of deaths in the population that is statistically attributable to vitamin D insufficiency (\u201cpopulation attributable risk proportion\u201d), a key measure of public health relevance of risk factors [[2](https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/12/12/3642/htm#B2-nutrients-12-03642)], these results imply that 87% of COVID-19 deaths may be statistically attributed to vitamin D insufficiency and could potentially be avoided by eliminating vitamin D insufficiency.\n> \n> Although results of an observational study, such as this one, need to be interpreted with caution, as done by the authors [[1](https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/12/12/3642/htm#B1-nutrients-12-03642)], due to the potential of residual confounding or reverse causality (i.e., vitamin D insufficiency resulting from poor health status at baseline rather than vice versa), it appears extremely unlikely that such a strong association in this prospective cohort study could be explained this way, in particular as the authors had adjusted for age, sex and comorbidity as potential confounders in their multivariate analysis. There are also multiple plausible mechanisms that may well explain the observed associations, such as increased concentrations of pro-inflammatory cytokines, as well as decreased concentrations of anti-inflammatory cytokines in vitamin D insufficiency [[3](https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/12/12/3642/htm#B3-nutrients-12-03642),[4](https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/12/12/3642/htm#B4-nutrients-12-03642)]. Although final proof of causality and prevention of deaths by vitamin D supplementation would have to come from randomized trials which meanwhile have been initiated (e.g., [[5](https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/12/12/3642/htm#B5-nutrients-12-03642)]), the results of such trials will not be available in the short run. Given the dynamics of the COVID-19 pandemic and the proven safety of vitamin D supplementation, it therefore appears highly debatable and potentially even unethical to await results of such trials before public health action is taken. Besides other population-wide measures of prevention, widespread vitamin D3 supplementation at least for high-risk groups, such as older adults or people with relevant comorbidity, which has been proven by randomized controlled trials to be beneficial with respect to prevention of other acute respiratory infections and acute acerbation of asthma and chronic pulmonary disease [[6](https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/12/12/3642/htm#B6-nutrients-12-03642),[7](https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/12/12/3642/htm#B7-nutrients-12-03642),[8](https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/12/12/3642/htm#B8-nutrients-12-03642),[9](https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/12/12/3642/htm#B9-nutrients-12-03642),[10](https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/12/12/3642/htm#B10-nutrients-12-03642)], should be promoted.

If low humidity and a high propensity for staying indoors were causatory, we'd expect to see influenza outbreaks through most of the Southwest USA and Australia in the summer (and we don't).  Additionally, we frequently see outbreaks in places that have high humidity in the winter months.  Vitamin D very well could constitute the main reason for the seasonality, but we just don't have enough data one way or the other.\n\nThere's a lot of historical evidence that Vitamin-D is far more important to the survival of populations than simply its ability to prevent rickets.  You're talking about something that's vital enough to population survival that it essentially drives the existence of multiple races.  Similarly, there's ample anthropological evidence that supplementation with Vitamin D corresponds very directly to high population level fitness and survival in northern climates.   Rickets doesn't really explain that.

If you want to argue Jesus didn\u2019t exist because the documentary evidence is flimsy, well the documentary evidence we have for most of antiquity is flimsy. We\u2019re not going to find a Jesus skeleton. It\u2019s likely that a Jesus figure did exist, but whether he was the one described in the Bible is debatable. Jesus is arguably a legendary figure, as in there was a person but his exploits are exaggerated, or they were done by someone else  but attributed to him and really our Jesus is an amalgamation of several people. The Gospels are filled with inconsistencies, misunderstood Old Testament theology and historical errors, however the idea that there was a religious zealot upset with the religious/political elites (and implicitly the Romans), preached against them and the corruption of the Jewish faith, and was slowly seeking to gain power for himself at some point, show was then executed, makes sense. \n\nIt\u2019s not an unlikely scenario, Jewish elites were very Romanized and prior to Roman conquest Hellenized, and much of the rural Jewish population hated this. It led to several revolts, such as the Maccabees revolt against the Seleucids, and then under the Romans several Roman Jewish wars (though these occurred after Jesus\u2019 time). It\u2019s likely that the Jewish revolts greatly influenced the New Testament as had been very common around the time it was being written, so tracing Jesus\u2019 lineage to David AND claiming he was \u201cKing of the Jews\u201d while also having stories about his return, would be the exact mind of messianic figure that rebellious Jews looking to expel the Romans would believe in. \n\nQuite frankly, the historicizing of Jesus I think makes him seem more realistic and comprehensible.

I did present arguments in another comment to your OP. Others responded and there was good dialogue, but you didn\u2019t engage with that comment thread. All good, I\u2019ll reproduce my comment here. But before I do I\u2019ll just encourage you to read/view actual respected scholars on the subject:\n\n[Bart Ehrman\u2019s book](https://www.amazon.com/Did-Jesus-Exist-Historical-Argument/dp/0062206443) on Jesus\u2019 historicity.\n\n[Dale Martin\u2019s undergraduate course lecture](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=d_dOhg-Fpu0) on historicity of Jesus.\n\nThe OG himself [Albert Schweitzer](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Quest_of_the_Historical_Jesus), who basically modernized historical Jesus studies.\n\nWith out further stalling: my original counter argument to your OP:\n\nThere is no hard evidence (like a body, tomb or other archaeological material), but we don\u2019t have anything like that for almost all 1st century Palestinians as well. However, the likelihood that there was a 1st century Jewish apocalyptic preacher by the name of Yeshua is pretty high. Very little we can say about him with a high degree of certainty\u2026 I would include the following: he gathered followers or disciples, he was almost certainly baptized by John, and was certainly crucified. There are historical criteria that can be used to determine the probability of certain details being true. For easy, accessible internet consumption of this type of historical scholarship, I recommend Dale Martin\u2019s Yale lectures, which you can watch for free on YouTube.\n\nAs for documentary evidence (which I consider evidence \u2014 whether good evidence or not depends on the source) - that does exist. The four canonical gospels and the apocryphal gospel of Thomas originate with oral tradition, which has its problems as a method of preservation. Still, with close analysis, scholars can glean some very cool info from them. Paul is the closest known source we have. We know Paul existed, we have some of his writings, and though he never met Jesus, he writes that he met Peter and the actual brother of Jesus, a guy named James. Now, that\u2019s not nothing. It\u2019s not a knock-down argument for Jesus\u2019 existence either, but I\u2019m putting it forward as a small piece of a larger picture.\n\nIn the end, do we have proof of Jesus existence? Of course not. But all of history is a matter of probability, and I think it\u2019s highly probable that there was a man named Jesus that was an itinerant rabbi who got on the wrong side of the law and was executed by the Roman authorities. \n\nSpeaking of the Romans, you mentioned something about crucifixion records? Do we have good reason to believe Romans kept regular records of crucifixions? I think we can understand they crucified plenty of people at that time, and especially on the outer rim of the empire where local cultures chafed against Roman rule and revolts were a real threat to the state. What records do we have of these executions? They seemed to happen regularly and summarily ordered by the ruling official. We shouldn\u2019t expect court stenography from this time. So I would be careful presuming that, because we don\u2019t have Jesus\u2019 arrest, conviction and sentencing records from Roman sources, therefore it didn\u2019t happen.", "polarity": "+"}, {"id": "jc7hjtp", "author": "TerbiumInside", "parent_id": "jc7hee0", "content": "I\u2019m going to look at this in more detail later, but I\u2019ll say right now I was wrong on Roman crucifixion records and mentioned it in some other conversations.\n\nI\u2019d like to actually read these books despite what I may think of their authors (or not), so I\u2019ll have to get on it.

He insists on the suggestion made by Urban von Wahlde that the first edition of John originated with \u201can elder,\u201d possibly an immediate associate of Jesus, and therefore is early (like, earlier than Mark) and more historical than the Synoptics.

Here's what I found and how I think it relates (sorry, it's long):\n\nPremise:  *Jesus - crucified, according to the Bible and Christian tradition, was resurrected ~33 AD*\n\n**Events recorded in the bible**\n\nThe Darkness (Matt. 27:45)\n\n\" From noon until three in the afternoon darkness came over all the land.\"\n\nThe Temple Veil Torn (Matthew 27:51a)\n\n\"At that moment the curtain of the temple was torn in two from top to bottom. \"\n\n*Note: The veil of the Temple was a huge curtain (60 feet long, 30 feet high, and about 4 inches thick; composed of 72 squares sewn together; so heavy that it required 300 men to lift it) that formed the barrier between the Shekinah presence of God and all human beings. It being torn in two would be as momentus as the floor of St. Peter's Basilica cracking in half.*\n\nThe Earthquake & Tombs Opened (Matthew 27:51b-53)\n\n\"The earth shook, the rocks split and the tombs broke open. The bodies of many holy people who had died were raised to life. They came out of the tombs after Jesus\u2019 resurrection and went into the holy city and appeared to many people.\"\n\nAfter the resurrection, Jesus himself appeared to more than 500 people (I Cor. 15:4, 6)\n\n\"that he was buried, that he was raised on the third day according to the Scriptures,... After that, he appeared to more than five hundred of the brothers and sisters at the same time\" \n\nThese events were so noteworthy that everyone in Jerusalem knew of them (Luke 24:13-18)\n\n\"Now that same day two of them were going to a village called Emmaus, about seven miles from Jerusalem. They were talking with each other about everything that had happened. As they talked and discussed these things with each other, Jesus himself came up and walked along with them; but they were kept from recognizing him. He asked them, \u201cWhat are you discussing together as you walk along?\u201d They stood still, their faces downcast. One of them, named Cleopas, asked him, \u201cAre you the only one visiting Jerusalem who does not know the things that have happened there in these days?\u201d\n\n**Extra biblical evidence**\n\nNone of these events are recorded or mentioned in any contemporary source except the bible. \n\nNot a word about 3 hours of darkness over Jerusalem and no record of a solar eclipse in Israel anytime around this date.\n\nNot a shred of evidence from any extra biblical source that the veil was torn in half.\n\nThe various geologic surveys show no record of an earthquake in or around Jerusalem during that time period.\n\nNot even a whisper of hearsay concerning corpses coming back to life and appearing to people, much less \"many people\". \n\nNo mention in any record that Jesus appeared to anyone after the crucifixion.\n\n**Response**\n\nPaul himself, speaking on the resurrection of the dead in general, and the resurrection of Jesus in particular, says the following (I Cor. 15: 12-17, emphasis added)\n\n\"But if it is preached that Christ has been raised from the dead, how can some of you say that there is no resurrection of the dead? If there is no resurrection of the dead, then not even Christ has been raised. And if Christ has not been raised, our preaching is useless and so is your faith. More than that, we are then found to be false witnesses about God, for we have testified about God that he raised Christ from the dead. But he did not raise him if in fact the dead are not raised. For if the dead are not raised, then Christ has not been raised either. ***And if Christ has not been raised, your faith is futile***\"\n\nSo, assuming Jesus was an historical figure, and there is no evidence whatsoever of the extraordinary and fantastic events surrounding the resurrection that were evidently common knowledge in that area at that time, it can be assumed that it didn't happen.

This is not actually a crazy idea.  Socrates himself never wrote anything down, or at least if he did then there is no record of it.  All we know of Socrates comes from the writings of Plato.  It is at least *possible* that Plato invented Socrates, using him as a tool to advance philosophical ideas which might be considered dangerous and subversive, or to stage hypothetical discussions to explain his philosophy more clearly.\n\nBut, from a modern perspective, does it really matter whether Socrates existed as a real person outside Plato's imagination?  In a sense, it does NOT matter.  The ideas and concepts expressed by Socrates are what survives and they are how we define him thousands of years later.  If it was actually Plato who came up with those ideas, then Plato essentially WAS Socrates, so in that sense Socrates was real.  If many others came up with those ideas and Plato merely assembled them together and attributed them to his fictional master, then Socrates still existed in THAT sense.  We can define his existence in this loose and almost metaphorical manner because, all these thousands of years later, we do not remember Socrates as a person anyway; we remember him by the collection of ideas and philosophical concepts credited to him (and because he allegedly drank hemlock and died).  \"Socrates\" is defined by his ideas and teachings, and those definitely exist, so therefore Socrates existed.\n\nIt can be said that Jesus Christ existed in exactly the same way.  Was he a real individual who said and did everything credited to him?  Was he a preacher whose reputation far outgrew reality?  Was he an invention of his supposed followers, a \"perfect\" entity who couldn't really exist so they made him up as an ideal to aspire to?  It could be said that any of these is sufficient to say that Jesus Christ was real.\n\n***HOWEVER...***\n\nThere's one little problem with drawing that parallel.  Our modern idea of who Jesus was is NOT defined solely by what he said and believed, or even by his actions.  Above everything else, Jesus Christ is said to be the divine Son of God; without that, he is not Christ.  I submit that even if there really, definitely was a single real person upon whom the story of Jesus was entirely based, that person was NOT Jesus Christ unless he can also truthfully claim to be God Incarnate upon Earth.  To say otherwise is to completely miss the point of who Jesus Christ is.\n\nIf we were to suddenly find solid evidence for \"Historical Jesus\", it would be fascinating and an important discovery, but without the divine connection it would be of zero religious significance.  We already know that a person or people existed who were the source of the ideas and preachings of Jesus.  SOMEBODY had to come up with them, or they wouldn't have been written down in the first place.  In order to say that Jesus Christ actually existed, we need evidence of the divine, because that defines who he is.

Him being born in Bethlehem rather than Nazareth, him being baptized by John the Baptist, having to work around people in Jesus' hometown thinking he was a crazy person (including members of his own family), Mark retaining the fact that Jesus healed people by rubbing his spit all over them (something the later gospels conveniently leave out), etc. The biggest one, of course, is his execution. All the gospel writers are falling over themselves to try and make it make sense, this unexpected betrayal of prophecy.

He was executed for sedition, his corpse rotted on the cross (as was Roman custom), and his brother James 'the righteous' succeeded in his leadership role.\n\nIt's only when one gets to Paul (the creator of Christianity) that we get the effects of Paul's Geschwind syndrome: belief in the divinity of Jesus, a resurrection (but only a spiritual, not a bodily, one), and that faith in this resurrection was the main thing required for personal salvation. But there are clues in both the seven consensus epistles and in 2nd half of Acts that Paul was a troubled man, and was in doctrinal conflict with James in Jerusalem. When one adds that Paul either doesn't know or relate anything about the historical Yeshua the Nazarine's life or teachings, I find his epistles survive the 'criterion of embarrassment'. They don't describe what transpired in reality, but what transpired in Paul's mind in \\~48-60 CE.\n\nWe also have a parallel form of the Jesus movement, in the 1st century Nazarenes through the 3rd century Ebionites, attested to in the sayings gospel 'Q', the epistles of James & Jude, the Didache, the Clementine Homilies/Recognitions, and heresiologists of the 3rd and 4th century. They all attest to a sect of Judaism that regarded Jesus as wise but not divine, did not believe in the bodily resurrection, believed that only Torah observance and good works could bring salvation, practiced vegetarianism and opposed animal sacrifice, and themselves regarded Paul as a heretic. These all fit the extant descriptions of James. That, to my mind, is the form of original Jesus movement in Judaism, and its diametrically opposed to Pauline Christianity.\n\nAnd James and his relationship to Jesus is attested to in Josephus in the *Antiquities of the Jews* (93\u201394 CE). The scholarly consensus is that the Testimonium Flavianum was amended by later scribal interpolation, and we have Arabic manuscripts without that later interpolation. But I don't have any difficulty accepting that James was a successor to the martyrs John and Jesus of their Hemerobaptist/Essene sect.\n\nIs all the rest of the Christ story created 'of whole cloth' from gentiles who never met anyone who had known the historical Jesus (most were dead by 70 CE), but were informed by Paul's interpretation? IMO, yes. Mark follows the Pauline interpretation: an adoptionist Christology, and an spiritual apotheosis, rather than a bodily resurrection. Only later manuscripts added the last parts of Mark 16.

There are a lot of people who were wandering around during the early first century (and actually, long before that as well as for quite a while after that) who were claiming to have divine birthright, or directly being the progeny of god... In fact, you can really draw a historical line going all the way back to ancient Sumer with various kings claiming to have inherited power from their relationship to the gods. In China, the first king of the Zhang dynasty (more than 4000 years BCE) claimed his right to the throne came from being the son of god (and by virtue, the divine power of his children after him by which they inherited his title). In Egypt, the various Pharaohs all claimed they were either living gods, children of gods (typically Isis), or otherwise had godlike power by birthright. In fact, its rather striking when you start looking at Jewish and early Christian mythology how much it resembles ancient Egyptian mythology (Apis, the bull god, was the son of Osiris, who was killed and resurrected, etc)... Rome itself was supposedly founded by Romulus and Remus, who were the sons of the god Mars, and most Roman leaders were deified either during their reign or posthumously, and on that topic, Greek and Roman mythology is RIPE with stories of Gods fathering mortal children...\n\nSo, in the first century AD, Jesus was definitely not the only character claiming to be the descendant of God. The Dead Sea Scrolls themselves actually make mention of someone (NOT Jesus) called the \"Teacher of Righteousness\", who was a messianic son of god as well. Of the records that do exist from that time period, the worst part about confirming or denying the existence of many of these things is of course, the poor translations, which is compounded by the censorship and destruction of a lot of those documents... For instance, the historian and writer Celsus wrote probably the earliest debunking of Christianity, which not only attacked the validity of Christianity, addressing its shortcomings in philosophy, attributing it as a movement of the poor and lower classes, and warning about it being a threat to the Roman empire, but then of course, all copies of were ordered destroyed during the 4th century. What remains of what he wrote is only known by the criticism of it nearly a century later by the Christian historian Origen in Contra Celsum (\"Against Celsus\"). Don't get me started on Justin Martyr...\n\nThen there is the issue of the gospels themselves. The major argument I've always presented was that they were written in GREEK, not in Hebrew as one would expect from Jews, Latin as one would expect from Romans, or any of the other expected languages of the region at the time (including Aramaic, which might have been possible as the language of \\[some of\\] the Apostles or Jesus himself). Besides that oddity, none of the authors identify themselves or provide any first hand accounts of meeting the apostles, so considering the Greek penchant for storytelling rather than history (Homer with the Iliad and Odyssey, for instance), it is quite likely that those gospels were interpretations of oral stories and traditions, rather than literal interviews and accounts. When you combine that knowledge with the aforementioned concepts of how many commonalities they share with other older religions, it begins to seem less and less likely that these gospels are historical evidence for Jesus existence and more likely to have been manufactured as entertainment for poor and lower class citizens, particularly the kind who might have been ostracized by the Romans, particularly the kind who probably could not read or write themselves, and would not have been educated enough to know Hebrew or Aramaic. They were also written around the same time as Celsus probably wrote The True Word, further lending question to their credibility.\n\nThe trouble with all that history, is we will probably never know as much as we want to or need to know about it, and the more time goes on, the more of it is lost to us. So whether or not there was an actual PERSON named Jesus or not at this point really seems inconsequential. We have to grow as a species and start looking at what evidence DOES exist and what we can scientifically state with accuracy about our own history and what that teaches us about our own existence. To be quite rude about it, there is no modern evidence for conversation with god, or any number of deities. There are plenty of people who claim to hear voices, and we have scientifically determined why that happens and we either treat those people or commit them to sanitariums for the good and safety of society. We live in an age where we've actually figured out what causes things like LEPROSY (perhaps the most ubiquitous biblical disease), and we can cure it, rather easily. We live in an age where we understand the various causes of blindness and we can treat and cure some of those. We have sunglasses and sunscreen. We understand the physics of water and can build boats with a much better degree of accuracy than they could hope to achieve back then, and to that degree, we've figured out not just how to fly, but we can reach the stars. They didn't even know what stars were. It was no miracle to see Jesus walk on water, and we can not only discredit the concept of the virgin birth, but we have more or less ascertained that if Jesus really did exist, he was probably fathered by a Roman soldier named Pantera (or Ben Pandera), and once again, to be quite rude about it, if GOD wanted to show us a miracle, he shouldn't have impregnated a 14 year old unwed teenager (that shit happens all the time); If I were GOD and I wanted to impress the populous, I would have made JOSEPH pregnant.

But still, I have to admit that it is more likely that a physical Jesus existed than not.\n\nOverall I think the gospels and Acts are mostly books of mythology.  All of them lie about mundane facts of history, geography, and/or astronomy.  They intentionally distored facts as plot points in their story.  If the gospels and Acts cannot be trusted to tell the truth about history, how can they be trusted to tell the truth about supernatural events?\n\nMy reason for thinking there was a historical is based mostly on Paul's letters.  Paul's authentic letters are the only books in the Bible that can be attributed to the claimed author where that author was a known person.  I find Paul's letters to be credible.  He had a big ego, but he seemed to be honest.  Even when he told the story of his vision it did not seem to be embellished.  By Paul's own words it could have been a vision he had as a dream.  Paul's own letters do not claim extraordinary healings.  Paul seemed to think the resurrection happened in heaven, not on earth.\n\nPaul said that he met Peter and James the Brother of Jesus.  The problematic phrase is \"Brother of Jesus.\"  The obvious reading is that James was the biological brother of Jesus.  Carrier *et. al.* have to develop an apologetic to explain it away.  They have to say that \"Brother\" was a religious title.  But this is the only person Paul uses it for.   \n\nThe thing that caused my faith crisis as a Christian was the apologetic arguments necessary to believe the Bible.  If the Bible were true, we should not even need apologetics.  But instead Christianity needs thousands of them.  \n\nThe thing that bothers me about Jesus mythicism is that it also requires apologetics which is not very good.  The apologetic argument again the \"brother of Jesus\" seems to be particularly weak.\n\nOverall, I think Robert Price summarized the situation quite well.  He said something to the effect that if Jesus existed, he was not the Jesus portrayed in the gospels.\n\nPaul's letters make it clear that Acts is a book of mythology.  Paul's letters flat out disagree with what Acts says about Paul.  Paul's letters also show the mythological nature of the gospels.  Paul does not seem to know any of the Jesus miracle stories.  Paul does not seem to know anything about the empty tomb.  Paul does not seem to know anything about the virgin birth.  If those stories existed at the time of Paul, he probably would have heard them.  Paul traveled all over the Christian world of his time.  He corresponded widely.  Why didn't he know the stories?

Atheists who haven't studied the Bible tend to discount anything that appears in the Bible.  They are the flip side of Bible literalists.  Both have reduced the Bible to one-dimensional items.  Both entirely misunderstand the Bible.\n\nI am glad that I studied the Bible so much as a Christian.  It helped me see the truth and become an atheist.  I don't have to just denounce the Bible.  I can see clearly its deeply flawed human origins.\n\nThe seven undisputed letters of Paul are unique in the Bible.  They are the only books in the Bible that were written by a known person who identified themselves.  To be clear, I am talking about what Paul himself says.  I am *not* talking about the mythical Paul of Acts, and I am not talking about the version of Paul that appears in the pseudepigraphical epistles.\n\nPaul comes across as an honest guy who has a big ego.  His honesty is refreshing compared to the rest of the Bible.  His claims of the miraculous are very limited.  His miracle claims are low-key.  The most miraculous thing he claims is his vision.  It is amazingly mundane.  Basically, he says he had either a dream or a vision of Jesus; he doesn't seem to be sure which it is. I find it very credible that he could have had a dream of Jesus.  I had some of those myself as a Christian, but I have a modern understanding of dreams.  They were seen as something different in the time of Paul.  Paul doesn't get struck blind or any of the other mythological elements that are included in the story of Acts.\n\nPaul says that he met Peter and James the brother of Jesus.  It is actually pretty funny because he does not like them.  At all.  He is not impressed by them or what they teach.  His story completely undercuts the mythology in Acts.   It also knocks out the mythology of the gospels.  \n\nPaul provides at least some evidence for Peter and James.  Paul was not a witness to the crucifixion.  But he was early enough to actually know people who had first-hand knowledge.  I think it is significant that Paul doesn't ascribe supernatural events to the crucifixion as other Bible authors do.  Paul also doesn't blame the Jews.  \n\nThere is still a question of what \"brother of Jesus\" means.  Mythicists have to claim that \"brother of Jesus\" is a religious title.  To me, that feels like an apologetic argument of the type that Christians have to use.  Paul doesn't use the term for anyone else.  He doesn't use it is a religious term.  The plain reading is biological brother.  But to me the most convincing thing is that Paul doesn't like James.  I don't think he would be using a religious term that recognized him as superior to Paul himself.\n\nThere is also the mention of James the brother of Jesus in Josephus.  But that is problematic on multiple levels, so I won't go further with it.\n\nI don't think Mary Magdeline is identified in Paul's letters.  For that I am relying mostly on Ehrman.  His line of reasoning is basically that she shows up in so many early stories it is likely that she was a real person.

The strange gyrations the story makes to try and explain how this is are not only demonstrably inaccurate, they make no sense in a purely fictional sense; that is, if purely fiction, why not just have Jesus Of Bethlehem?\n\nBecause when Matthew invented his birth narrative, he had to contort the story to fit multiple apparently-contradictory prophecies.\n\nMatthew 2:23 says:\n\n> He went and lived in a town called Nazareth. So was fulfilled what was said through the prophets, that he would be called a Nazarene.\n\nNo such prediction exists in our current Old Testament, so we don't know what source Matthew is quoting.  Maybe he was drawing on a now-unknown source, maybe he was being metaphorical (e.g. Isaiah 11:1 says \"A shoot will come up from the stump of Jesse; from his roots a Branch will bear fruit\" and the Hebrew root of \"Nazareth\" is the same as that for _netser_, meaning \"branch\"), but the point is that whoever wrote Matthew clearly felt that Jesus being associated with Nazareth fulfilled an important prophecy.\n\nBut!  Matthew 2:4-6 says:\n\n> When he had called together all the people\u2019s chief priests and teachers of the law, he asked them where the Messiah was to be born.  \u201cIn Bethlehem in Judea,\u201d they replied, \u201cfor this is what the prophet has written:\n\n> \u201c\u2018But you, Bethlehem, in the land of Judah,  \n> are by no means least among the rulers of Judah;  \n> for out of you will come a ruler  \n> who will shepherd my people Israel.\u2019\u201d\n\nSo a prophecy says the messiah will be from Nazareth and a prophecy says the messiah will be from Bethlehem and Matthew's messiah has to somehow fulfill both.  How to do that?\n\nEasy: invent a narrative that has Jesus born in Bethlehem and raised in Nazareth so he can \"come forth\" from Bethlehem but be called \"a Nazarene.\"\n\nNotice that Luke also posits that Jesus was born in Bethlehem and ends up in Nazareth, but invents a _different_ reason to place Jesus's birth in Bethlehem (one that we know is false because the dates are wrong for Quirinius's governorship and Roman censuses Did Not Work That Way).\n\nNotice also that Matthew adds a detour to Egypt that isn't present in Luke, so that he can shoehorn in another prophecy about God calling \"his son\" (originally Israel) out of Egypt.\n\nAnd of course both birth narratives were invented by their authors, because no birth narrative is present in Mark, the gospel that Matthew and Luke almost entirely copy.\n\nWhile you could take the contradiction as being evidence of the gospels tacking a fictional Bethlehem birth onto the story of a historical figure from Nazareth, I'd say it's much stronger evidence for the idea that _both_ the Bethlehem connection _and_ the Nazareth claim were fictional because both authors were clearly more concerned with \"fulfilling the scriptures\" than reporting history.\n\n---\n\nThis isn't the first time the gospels (primarily Matthew) would have done this, taking scripture literally and tweaking his story to make it seem like Jesus fit whatever prophecy he was looking at.  For instance, Zechariah 9:9 says:\n\n> Behold, your king is coming to you, humble, and **mounted on a donkey, and on a colt**, the foal of a donkey.\n\nThe parallelism in Zechariah is a poetic device; see e.g. [here](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/palm-sunday-confusion-did_b_516321) for an explanation.  The gospel of Mark knows it's a poetic device and has Jesus ride into Jerusalem on a colt in Mark 11:7:\n\n> When they brought the colt to Jesus and threw their cloaks over it, he sat on it\n\nBut that's not enough for Matthew, who takes the \"prophecy\" literally, so he changes that to make Jesus literally ride both a donkey _and_ a colt at the same time:\n\n> And brought the ass, and the colt, and put on them their clothes, and they set him thereon.\n\nAgain, the gospel author shows that he's not concerned about reporting historical fact, but rather providing \"evidence\" that his Jesus fits the prophecies around a messiah.\n\n---\n\n>  There is also Jesus following and being baptized by John The Baptist. The fact that the son of God would need to be baptized, and would be following another religious leader seems another odd point to include in something that would be purely fictional.\n\nIt makes perfect sense if you want to deliberately construct a story to show that your own guy is more awesome than the other guy.\n\nThere's no historical evidence at all that John the Baptist was doing his thing as \"preparation\" for anyone else, but Mark 1 claims that that's what he was doing, putting the words in his mouth that \"After me comes the one more powerful than I, the straps of whose sandals I am not worthy to stoop down and untie\" when he baptizes Jesus, and Matthew 3 has him claim that _Jesus_ was supposed to baptize _him_.\n\nComing up with that story is much like the early Catholic Church co-opting pagan holidays for Christian ones, or the Roman religion claiming that the gods of conquered peoples were _really_ the Roman gods under other names, or Islam claiming that Jesus was totally a real prophet but not as cool of a prophet as Mohammed, or any number of other examples of religious syncretism throughout history: it takes the existing religious belief of some other group and shows how their belief is better by absorbing and changing the other belief to serve their own.\n\nThere's also the fact that anyone hearing about Jesus in the early days might know that John the Baptist existed and want to know how he tied into the whole thing, so the gospels would want to come up with _some_ story to explain things.\n\nIt's like how any claim that Jesus was crucified by the Romans would need to come up with a story about who did it and why, so the gospels feature Pontius Pilate, but their depiction of him is completely at odds with the historical Pilate: the gospels' Pilate is a chill guy who basically says \"Well, the crowds want to kill him, guess I should let them do it, sorry Jesus\" whereas the actual historical Pilate was known for being too _harsh_ on agitators and more than willing to send in soldiers to break up a riot.  The story incorporates a real contemporary figure, but in a way that fits with the story the gospel is trying to tell rather than their actual historical personality.\n\n---\n\n> Of course, that obviously doesn't support anything divine or mythical (actually is a bit contradictory on that point), but it is a small amount of evidence of a real person being somewhere behind some of the stories.\n\nIt could be, certainly, but it's also evidence for the idea that the \"Jesus\" figure was constructed out of a variety of scriptural sources to support a variety of goals, and so the resulting stories have contradictions because the source narratives had contradictions and any historical figures found in them are out of character because they're building a narrative, not reporting historical fact.", "polarity": "+"}, {"id": "jc4h9cm", "author": "crikett23", "parent_id": "jc486xh", "content": "Yes, I get the poetic device use.  The main thing we are looking at different is the Nazareth element.  I do not look at this as being a specific prophecy, but more likely one of three things - or, as I  conjectured in my original post, more of a combination of those things.  Either a slight mistranslation of branch, or implication that coming from Nazareth was more literal in meaning as a branch of the divine; second, the overall unfavorable view of the area that would be popular around the time of the Gospel's writing, relating back to prophecy around lowly birth; and lastly, as I already mentioned (and not in contradiction to the previous options), the basis of an actual religious teacher from that time and locale.\n\nThe evidence for John the Baptist is certainly great than for Jesus (as far as there is some), and based on early church writings, it seems there was quite a bit of crossover related to his teachings compared with teachings that would later be attributed to Jesus.  Combined with what I said earlier...\n\nThough I am not sure it is that similar to the co-opting of other religious traditions (or iconography, which I've always thought has more potential connections to the crucifixion  than any historical happening).  That is because the early church was a religion for Jewish people, and, if there was a historical Jesus, this would've been what he was teaching - a non-orthodox version of Judaism.  Most of the co-opted elements seem to have arrived with what I can only think of as some form of marketing, as Christianity moved to become a religion of the masses.\n\nOf course, problematic in all of this is most sources we have now are those that were considered \"official\" well after the events in question.

But what you said in your prior post was that (emphasis mine):\n\n> there are certain contradictions in the Gospel accounts that **seem only explainable** by the fact that they were attempting to connect a real person to the stories\n\n...when my point was that not only is it possible to posit explanations that don't assume a historical core (as I did) but the fact that Matthew and Luke were already willing to straight-up invent \"historical\" details that we _know_ to be false in order to make their narrative fit Torah prophecies makes it very likely that they would _also_ invent the \"of Nazareth\" part when that's based on a prophecy as well.\n\n>  That is because the early church was a religion for Jewish people,\n\nOn the contrary: while the early church did grow out of Judaism, it wasn't just \"for\" the Jews, it was also popular among the Gentiles, and at the time there were large efforts by Paul to incorporate them into the church and debates within the church as to \"how Jewish\" the religion should be.\n\nHence Matthew being a very Judaic spin on Mark while Luke was a more Gentile spin on Mark: the gospels _themselves_ were essentially \"some form of marketing\" written in order to persuade difference audiences within the church to take certain stances on various positions and to pitch different messages to various external audiences they were hoping to convert.\n\nI'm definitely not saying that you _couldn't_ see the gospels as pointing toward some historical core figure around whom a bunch of myths later grew up, but it's not the case that that's the only (or even the most likely) option given the available evidence regarding the clearly literary nature of the gospels and the syncretic nature of early Christian religion.", "polarity": "+"}, {"id": "jc2h1tn", "author": "geophagus", "parent_id": "11qd3sv", "content": "There IS evidence.

Fear, a lack of mental health support, and easy access to weapons come to mind. Probably more, but these come to mind at the moment. \n\nReligion is partly responsible for the first two. There are secular sources, but religion is just an easy vehicle for it. Religion generates fear by teaching followers that non-believers are in danger of eternal suffering, are a source of evil, etc. Setting themselves up as the \u201clast bastion of morality and sanctity\u201d or whatever. Mental health support, while seemingly there through community, probably doesn\u2019t actually exist. Mental issues are written off as mental impurity, the work of demons, doubt, the literal word of god, or other such examples. Doubting the church usually nets you threats speaking of how they\u2019ll take away your community and connections to family. Also threats of suffering. Since there is no alternative information source allowed and mental issues are ignored, people are stuck in a bubble telling them that they are constantly in danger. That (almost) all thoughts of combating that danger is the right way to do it. Their view of reality warped, their judgement impaired.\n\nWeapons themselves aren\u2019t necessarily a problem themselves. More so *who has them* and *how they\u2019re used*. The only people who would want a weapon are enthusiasts, people with a professional use for them (hunters for ex.), and people who want to defend themselves. The paranoid people will fall into the last group. Since they often can\u2019t accurately read their situation, they\u2019ll likely default to their fears. Robbery, a demon, whatever could be applicable. A lack of (proper) screening will let just about anyone wield a weapon. Even the paranoid. \n\nWhile it does lead to the idea gun availability is the problem, that conclusion ignores **why** people want weapons and choose to use them irresponsibly. Gun availability is just one of the reasons it\u2019s a problem. Fear and a lack of mental health support are also part of the reason. Someone who is sound of mind and/or not living in fear is less likely to misuse a gun despite availability. You need to address multiple factors to actually get rid of the problem. Reducing gun availability only will just lead to people using improvised guns or melee weaponry. \n\nI\u2019d say more, but I think I\u2019d make this too long otherwise. \n\nTLDR:\nBlaming America\u2019s gun violence problem on just one thing is short sighted. Fear, lack of mental health support, and gun availability together are at least part of the cause if not the entirety of it. Religion is simply an easy vehicle for fear and lack of mental health support. Also only partly responsible for it. Secular sources exist. Fear and lack of mental support leads to hasty and fearful defensive reactions to normal situations, like someone accidentally getting in the wrong car.", "polarity": "-"}, {"id": "jidoshl", "author": "penny-wise", "parent_id": "jibymjt", "content": "Guns.

You can't just spend your whole life being an a******, killing people and doing all sorts of awful stuff and then at the end say, \"I believe in Jesus!\" and then go to heaven. It isn't that simple.\n\nJames 2 verse 26: \"For as the body apart from the spirit is dead, so also faith apart from works is dead.\"\n\nWhat James is trying to say is that simply professing faith in God is not enough. You can claim to believe in God but if you live your life as if you don't care about what God wants you to do in your life, then you don't truly have faith. You're living for yourself, not for god.\n\nFaith is more than just saying you believe. It's living the life. It's following the path that God put before you. It's making an effort and showing love for God by making that effort. \n\nWill doing good works and being a good person earn you heaven? No, as that comes from God. But if you do not do good works and you do not live your life in honor of God, then you are not with God. The good works and living your life in honor of God is an outgrowth of faith. It's a necessary component of faith.\n\nSo if you think that you can live your whole life in opposition to God and then at the last minute say you believe in God, you're in for a rude awakening. Do I believe that deathbed conversions can happen? Sure. But for that to happen there has to be true contrition. And I don't believe that just being afraid of death and saying \"I believe in God now!\" is enough.

You can get to know Him, and you really seriously should, but never say that you know Him, for He is bigger than we can imagine.\n3. God uses people. There is a reason, a spiritual law as to why God had to become human and come to save the earth as a human being.\n\nFrom acts 10 (you should read it): \"So the angel said to Cornelius, \u201cYour prayers and your alms have come up for a memorial before God. Now send men to Joppa, and send for Simon whose surname is Peter. He is lodging with Simon, a tanner, whose house is by the sea. He will tell you what you must do.\u201d\n\nNotice the angel didn't tell this guy Cornelius what to do. The angel wasn't allowed to do that. Instead he pointed out a human to whom Cornelius needs to talk to for direction. Because this world is run by humans.

He could have made it thr way it is now, without sacrificing himself to himself. I mean he's all powerful. He can make it be any way he wants. He CHOSE to make it difficult to cleanse our sins, and then CHOSE to have himself crucified to \"save us\" when he could have just changed the rules anytime he wanted. So all that suffering for Jesus and everyone else was unnecessary\n\n>So because God loves you and is a merciful one he gave you the way out of damnation that could never be avoided anyway.\n\nCouldn't he have just made it so the damnation didn't exist in the first place?

I don't know how he came to be. I can only tell you what I read in the Bible. Wouldnt it be weird to make boring perfect robots that are programmed to all be the same? Life and your uniqueness is a gift in itself. Your inside voice and morals can't be seen but you know they exist.  I don't understand the complex order he placed everything in. Why we have to be imperfect. Maybe because we wouldnt enjoy anything if it was all easy all the time. And I'm not supposed to know everything. I do know for a fact he is real. Creation points to creator. That's not hard to see or prove. There is a unique and complex design to the world we live in. Multiple religions all report the same historical events and even multiple ones speak of Jesus. However only one book tells us he is son of God. And he is the most mocked and hated in society. Its not cool to make fun of any other religion why isnt it disrespectful when its Christianity. Because Jesus is truth. Biblical prophecy is also being fulfilled even this year. And if you look into it the Bible has more evidence than any other historical document in history by 10 fold. I found the good through seeing my demon possessed ex boyfriend. If demons are real I know God had to be. They have to coexist. I think saying all this just magically fell into place is ignorant. And furthermore I've felt the presence of God myself.

Whereas when I landed in the US to visit last year, I saw hundreds on my way from the airport to my city a couple few hours away. \n\n\nCost of living is higher here relative to wages, there's practically zero mental health resources, and there's practically zero government assistance or homeless shelters. \n\n\nThe principle difference is this is a family-centered society, and it's considered shameful to have a family member on the street at night. Even complete strangers would offer a place to stay. \n\n\nI think a lot comes down to our American materialistic culture that prevents us from solving many problems. By default, our answer is to throw money at things and when they don't improve, it must be because we haven't spent enough money.

Sure there are people now especially who are getting on the street as a result of financial crises - but even that's a complicated problem that doesn't have a simple fix. \n\n\nI guess what I'm trying to say is that we need to be patient and willing to spend the time understanding the roots of these systemic problems and acknowledge that it's going to take a lengthy, multi-faceted approach requiring a lot of cooperation to begin to affect the rates of homelessness. Likewise, on the individual level, we can't assume that just because we have a home and they don't that we are in a place to solve their problems.

In mine, they're just people.  Even the violent tweaker who I guess took too much meth and tweak pulled the trigger on his gun and killed my father, my brother, my son, or me.

The rest of us aren't. We cannot ***be*** Jesus and sincerely carry his attitude - except artificially, through the special grace of adoption. \"Oh yes! I'm universally compassionate - just like Jesus!\" That's not how the minds of sinners, even redeemed sinners, work. One perfect Jesus...but then there's the rest of us. We can attempt to walk in his path but we are inherently incapable of filling his shoes/sandals. That's what makes him special.\n\nSecond, application of universal forgiveness essentially depends upon two prior factors: 1) *true repentance*, and 2) *atonement*. Recall that Jesus had *nothing* to say to the \"bad\" thief on the cross, and he only promised Paradise to the \"good\" thief *after* the thief had shown repentance and faith. Perhaps Jesus, after all, concluded that the bad thief was being justly punished - a sign that Jesus's compassion was tempered with retributive justice. The good thief chastises the other thief that \"we deserve our punishment\" and Jesus doesn't disagree. \n\nBiblically, repentance and atonement are the necessary conditions for forgiveness. Neither JBap nor Jesus preached entry into the Kingdom without repentance and atonement. This is what is missing in \"woke\" Christian social theory. The unhoused are given a free ticket NOT to repent, not to atone, and not to change their ways. On the contrary, they are given  gratis - food, shelter, clothing, laundry services, warming centers...and a battery of \"sustenance drugs\" and needle exchange sites. I'm saying if Jesus approves of that, and the churches promote it, they're only exacerbating the problem.\n\nIf murdering brigands like Barabbas are fostered, only misery and chaos will result for the rest of society. \"Jesus sets 'em free!\" - free to carry out all the anti-social, criminal acts that shatter order and result in real physical and financial harm to the rest of society. \n\nIn my town the mayor ordered police to turn a blind eye to the depredations of the homeless, only arresting them for the most egregious violent crimes. And that's not to mention that the homeless are destroying the river's riparian zone with their illegal fires, dumping human and other waste into the water - while the environmentalist have a \"hands-off\" policy. The homeless are in this sense privileged and above the law. Several churches support this criminal element and only contribute to the horrors.

Your truth fascinates me mate, and I thank you for sharing it with me.  \nI like your thing about the bad thief and the good thief.  I didn't know there was a bad thief.  Though it appears both thieves did mock him on the cross, as I looked it up after this.  (Matthew 27:44)\n\nI guess I subscribe to a Jesus that didn't set boundaries on forgiveness.  Such is possible because this spirit can exist in people as well.  I'm not familiar with Jesus specifically requiring repentance or atonement.  I AM familiar with the Church embracing these concepts as part of their faith.  But the man Himself?  I've never heard it come 'from the horses mouth' as it were.\n\nI looked into this a bit, and found, \"And when you stand praying, if you hold anything against anyone, forgive them, so that your Father in heaven may forgive you your sins.\u201d  So no mention of the importance of repentance there.  But another passage states, \u201c\u2026 If thy brother trespass against thee, rebuke him; and if he repent, forgive him\u201d.  Both quotes from Jesus.\n\nSo I guess the first one appears as the 'woke Jesus of legend' and the second the uhh.... non-woke Jesus of legend?  All I can say to that end, is that forgiveness in my life has never needed to be awarded at the price of being rebuked, and not even repented.  Repentance is a great thing one would usually hear in most situation.  I find the idea of having to rebuke or scold someone over anything to be unnecessary.  I find it opens doors of resentment between people and I'm quite mature enough to let things go.  Wherever you go in this world you find people arguing about one thing or another.  Living where you have to rebuke everyone for their transgressions against you I find you quickly create a hostile environment for both parties.  I will gladly just let something go.  Letting go to me is a skill that breeds peace and harmony in all things.  I do in fact subscribe to unconditional forgiveness and try to live by it - however that doesn't mean I'm not hurt by the things people do sometimes.  Nor does it mean they instantly regain their previous standing of trust with me.  It just means I'm not holding onto grudges.\n\nJesus could of been born into you or me though.  We're all Gods children.  I didn't mean to imply that we would directly replace Jesus or that we are directly the same man that was here all those years ago.

And Pence being openly critical of him for that one thing (though a very important thing in Trump and his supporters' eyes) means he has zero chance of election.\n\nYou're also ignoring the views of Christians the previous six years.  White evangelicals are the core of Trump's supporters and have been since at least his 2016 election (in sharp contrast to their support for Cruz during the primary).

Or after 2022, when all of his hand-picked candidates in swing states lost.  Yet he is currently the frontrunner.
