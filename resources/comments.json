Korea, Taiwan and China would know, but do not have enough cases right now for this to occur. I know of no Chinese publication for their first wave regarding cooks.\n\nI suggest this because of data on the extreme amount of virus found in saliva, up to 10^11 RNA copies per ml. This would suggest 10^7 RNA copies in a larger, \u00b5l-size speech droplet.\nTest yourself, speak very loud (like in a kitchen) for a few minutes above a glass surface, then look at the droplets that landed there.\nI mean, Burger King, for example, requires kitchen workers to wear a mask because of this. But I've seen mask wearing in fast food, people pull it down to wipe their nose with bare fingers, touch the mask, then the food, it's a mess.\n\nThe aerosol discussion consensus seems to be that 10^2 to 10^3 are an infectious dose when inhaled.\nFor ingestion, this could be much higher due to surface to volume ratio, of course. But chewing creates aerosol, and this is a few inches from the lung. Also, the virus replicates very well in throat tissue. And low pH values do not inactivate the virus. You'd have to rely on stomach enzymes for gastrointestinal tissue.\n\nRNA copies and active virus are different things, of course. Unfortunately, I have not found a TCID50 experiment with patient saliva yet, but I know there is at least one currently planned, especially for food safety.\nUntil then, I would not assume that virus assembly efficiency is very different for aerosol and larger droplets.\n\nMy personal guess would be that they are legally safe in saying that the risk is low compared to direct contact.\nBut I would not be surprised if food would account for 5% of all cases, not just restaurants, but also refrigerated fresh produce and meat.

It ended up as a bit of a wall.  But basically I tried to give some examples of vaccines and the way they work and the reason why what you're saying will not be done.  I'm not offended if you don't read the entire thing.\n\n----\n\nI just think you're a bit confused.  You can't make a vaccine for all coronaviruses.  Coronaviruses are a category of numerous viruses.  We have a coronavirus vaccine for livestock, but it is for one singular coronavirus.  They can still catch other coronaviruses.  That just isn't how vaccines work.  You cannot make a singular vaccine that works against every single virus of a specific class.  Vaccines do not and will never (during our lifetime) work that way.  The way vaccines work is by creating a specific antibody response to a specific pathogen.  Antibodies are specific to a disease, not generic.  Vaccines cannot work broadly, as they would not be trigger a specific antibody response to a specific pathogen otherwise.\n\nI'll use bacteria for an example, since I'm more familiar with naming conventions and certain vaccines.  Neisseria is a genus of bacteria, meaning it's a category of bacteria with relatively similar characteristics, thought to be genetically more related to one another rather than those in the Candida genus, for example.  There are numerous types of Neisseria bacteria.  Among the most significant in huamans are Neisseria gonorrheae (causes the STD gonorrhea) and Neisseria meningitidis (causes a severe, rapidly fatal, and highly contagious meningitis).\n\nCurrently, we have a N. meningitidis vaccine, but vaccines are specific.  It does not and will never affect the other genus of Neisseria, as the bacteria in this genus are too genetically distinct to be affected by a vaccine.  So getting an N meningitidis vaccine has zero affect on your ability to contract N gonorrheae (gonorrhea).  Because again, vaccines do not work broadly.  They are too genetically distinct.  That goes against the very nature of what it means to be a vaccine and how antibodies work.\n\nEven among N meningitidis, there are multiple subtypes of the bacteria, as there often are with any pathogen.  We have vaccines against some of the most common subtypes.  But being vaccinated with subtype A only gives you **zero** protection against subtype B.  Antibodies are a highly highly specific immune response and, even among the same genus, there are too many genetic variations to just have a singular N meningitidis vaccine that works against all types.  You can combine some of the vaccines into a singular shot, yes, but that's not the point.  All of these vaccines needed to be developed separately, even if they are able to combine a few of them physically in the same test tube in the end.\n\nLet's look at another example...HPV (human papilloma virus).  HPV is virtually ubiquitous in humans.  But certain subtypes are known to cause certain types of cancers like cervical cancers.  We currently have a vaccine against some of the subtypes of HPV that cause the greatest incidence of cancer.  But they do not and will never protect against all HPV subtypes.  There are just too many and there is less of a real reason to do so.  Even with the HPV vaccines we have, they had to individually research and create each one.  But again, being vaccinated only against say, HPV type 16, does not give you any protection whatsoever against HPV type 8, for example.  Even if ultimately, you are able to put the HPV 16 and HPV 8 vaccines in the same syringe, it doesn't change the fact that each had to individually be developed.  And no, we will never have a vaccination against all HPV forms.  It just isn't feasible or necessary.\n\nThen you get things like the influenza vaccine, which has to be altered slightly each year because of how frequently and readily the virus mutates.  If SARS-CoV-2 will behave similarly, there will be issues in creating a singular vaccine that will work for more than one year at a time.\n\nAnd then you have certain diseases where our bodies are just unable to maintain a significant immune response for a period of time for whatever reason.  Take rabies, for example.  Rabies is a 99.999999% fatal disease if you catch it.  But, we actually have a vaccine against it!  But the immune response to the vaccine only lasts maybe a year at a time for humans.  So in order to remain immune to the virus, you'd need a yearly vaccine.  We've found that for the general population, this is just far too costly and not really feasible or necessary.  Instead, we've found that it works better to vaccinate our pets (who are more likely to be in contact with animal carriers) and those traveling to endemic areas.\n\nThen, you have some diseases where, unfortunately, we just aren't able to generate that strong of an immune response from the vaccine for some reason.  Some countries vaccinate against Mycobacterium tuberculosis, which causes TB.  Weirdly enough, the vaccine does not give total immunity to the disease, and flat out just doesn't seem to work in adults for some reason.\n\nVery very rarely, catching a certain disease provides cross immunity to another disease, but again, it's very very uncommon.  There was a really popular example people use when talking about this, but unfortunately it escapes my memory, sorry.  But typically, it only offers limited protection instead of 100% immunity anyway.  We know that it doesn't work this way for the entire class of coronaviruses though, as people who have had other forms of coronavirus (colds) are still able to contract COVID-19.\n\nFortunately, for people at risk of pneumonia, there actually is a pneumonia vaccine that covers some of the most common causes of pneumonia, but it can never protect against all forms unfortunately, and you do have to periodically get it again.\n\nSo as you see, vaccines are far more complicated than \"just create a vaccine for every single coronavirus/the category of coronaviruses\".\n\nAnyway, hope this helps a bit.", "sentiment": 0.9879}, {"id": "fof3gq3", "author": "scionkia", "parent_id": "foe7zt3", "content": "Well spoken.

But this is a personal opinion.\nSo, let's say that I'm skeptical about human nature in general and about the specific ambitions of pharma companies, universities and governments. I prefer not to develop this too much as we would fall into politics and other considerations (and it would be a different debate itself), but this is mostly my point.\n\nI'm not specifically concerned about this kind of measures being taken under such an urgent situation like the current one, but the fact that these practices can start to be just assumed with not enough debate and that they might last even when this situation is more controlled.\nThe urgency of the situation demand to be flexible and adapt (and researchers are already doing this worldwide: the timelines have very little to do -much quicker- than any previous one and sharing preprints e.g. was not extended in Medicine until this), but we shouldn't miss the point that long-term decisions and standards should be discussed quietly and urgency is not the best criteria for more solid and effective projections.\nAnd it's a fact that there have been abuses and bad praxis in the past both in research (in general) as in some pharma companies.\n\nAdditionally, I think that a too focus on a vaccine scope could neglect other aspects of the fight against the virus, that could be useful too and could have long-term benefits both for public health and to be prepared for future scenarios.\nSometimes I have the feeling that there's a lot of pressure to sort this out asap and close it, while this would be a terrible mistake. We have to learn and introduce improvements, not only on the clinical trial methodology, but in many other things. Imo, some people are failing to understand this, as they are not seeing the problem from a scientific perspective, so they might not be able to see the bigger picture.\nThis threat was something that was warned in advance several times and we had previous 'warnings' that seem to have been dismissed. We cannot afford to make the same mistake again. For instance, multi-resistant bacteria is a threat possible much scarier than CoV-SARS-2 and clinicians and researchers have been warning about them since long ago.\nWe need to design ambitious strategies to be better prepared, so IMO, the focus on speed can somehow distort the importance of this.\n\nOn the other hand, I work in clinical research, so I'm quite aware that wrong decisions on this topics could lead to decrease general trust in research and in science and the historical precedents show that this can result on a very long-standing damage to public health in general. So, simplistic approaches tend to trigger my skepticism, as complex problems demand complex solutions.\n\nAs I said, I accept there are other different criterias to mine and there might always be some of level of disagreement, but these issues shouldn't be focused like a soccer game where some people support a team and the other support their adversary.\nDiversity of criteria and points of view can always be constructive and useful to try to achieve scientific consensus.\nI personally support more the approach defended on this article than the ones focused on speed, but I think this is a valid and interesting discussion that ideally should be done rationally and quietly, leaving emotions and sensationalism aside:\nhttps://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-00751-9", "sentiment": 0.6477}, {"id": "frhzmci", "author": "rookinn", "parent_id": "frhgovl", "content": "I\u2019m sick of this comment.

But said this, I'm currently involved on a few trials about this disease, so my approach is not destructive at all and I believe personal attacks don't add any value to the discussion.\nI have never said that the vaccine is worthless or anything similar.\n\nI just said that I don't think the vaccine looks as promising as was suggested at first, and this is a personal opinion.\nThere was a huge hype and a lot of attention put onto this trial, but there are many others that haven't been receiving the same attention and might be promising too.\n\nThis is what was published (NYT) about a month ago about this trial:\n\n>*The Oxford scientists now say that with an emergency approval from regulators, the first few million doses of their vaccine could be available by September \u2014 at least several months ahead of any of the other announced efforts \u2014 if it proves to be effective.\nNow, they have received promising news suggesting that it might.\nScientists at the National Institutes of Health\u2019s Rocky Mountain Laboratory in Montana last month inoculated six rhesus macaque monkeys with single doses of the Oxford vaccine. **The animals were then exposed to heavy quantities of the virus that is causing the pandemic \u2014 exposure that had consistently sickened other monkeys in the lab. But more than 28 days later all six were healthy**, said Vincent Munster, the researcher who conducted the test.\n\u201cThe rhesus macaque is pretty much the closest thing we have to humans,\u201d Dr. Munster said, noting that scientists were still analyzing the result. He said he expected to share it with other scientists next week and then submit it to a peer-reviewed journal.\nImmunity in monkeys is no guarantee that a vaccine will provide the same degree of protection for humans. A Chinese company that recently started a clinical trial with 144 participants, SinoVac, has also said that its vaccine was effective in rhesus macaques.

Contract to popular belief, a vaccine isn't a magical shield. You can still get symptoms when exposed to the virus, it's just much much more mild and for a much shorter duration. So if you expose a few thousand vaccinated young adults to this virus, they can still have mild symptoms, such as a few sniffles, or even a short fever.  This vaccine primes your immune system for a battle--but **that battle still occurs** and hopefully it's over with so quickly that you have no symptoms, or it was just a few sniffles that you thought were allergies.\n\nBut that doesn't tell us anything if upwards of 30% of SARS-CoV-2 infections are already asymptomatic to begin with, and another 50% infections are only very mild in nature. We can't definitively tell whether they recovered quickly because they had the vaccine or just because they're young and healthy. You can even still test positive with an RT-PCR test after being vaccinated. And you can also spread it to other people unknowingly if you were given the virus up your nose and you sneezed on the way home. It's not practical to fully isolate thousands of people for 14-28 days.\n\nThe alternative is to give the challenge to older adults at a large number (N=1000+) where we could truly see if the disease progressed to pneumonia or worse.  The problem here is that if the vaccine doesn't work, then you've just either killed a lot of older people or at best, you've overwhelmed the healthcare system and many other people will die who can't get an ICU bed. The safer and more scientific way is collecting blood plasma and finding neutralizing antibodies which can easily be tested against *in vitro*. That's the money shot, and that can be done without a challenge trial. So far in the Moderna trial, everyone that they've tested so far has developed nAbs that can defeat SARS-CoV-2.

The vaccine guards against more moderate cases but there is something about more severe cases that evades the vaccine. Thus a vaccinated person who would otherwise get a severe case still gets a severe case (i.e. your chance of severe disease is unchanged regardless of whether you are vaccinated).\n3. The vaccine provides 94 percent protection against disease but the percentage of people among those who get sick who go on to get severe disease is the same (i.e. your chance of severe disease is reduced by 94 percent)\n4.

Severe disease is still uncommon enough and the vaccine is overall effective enough that we don't know if it's further limiting severe disease beyond its extremely high regular efficacy.\n\nInterestingly, the Oxford vaccine, which had a much higher number of vaccinated people with symptoms, still had no severe disease.

It's pretty much the backbone of the statistics that lets all this work so well, and this is also why randomized drug trials are considered much stronger than observational ones.\n\n> And when they say that the vaccine was 95% effective, what if people in the vaccine group did develop covid but either had mild covid with few symptoms (didn't report them) or reported them but tested negative for covid (not uncommon due to the high false negative rate).\n\nIf it's due to the false negative rate, then as I said the randomization means the same thing should've occurred in the control group too - which it didn't. And if it's the first one happening only in the vaccine group, _caused_ by the vaccine, that's still fine - that means you'll only develop very mild covid and not be serious.

I have read different research studies around coronavirus that were in fact not all that well randomized. One example would be the early studies on antibodies where volunteers to get tested for antibodies were not representative of the population and were rather self selected groups of people that were more likely to have had the disease. \n\nCovid is new. There are a lot of factors and variables to consider. Some that we didn't even know about closer to the start of the pandemic. Things are dynamic here. \n\nIt does in fact matter if people in the vaccine group had mild disease or false negatives. You can't assume that this happened in the control group too because the vaccine could have reduced symptoms. Mild covid can still cause long term complications. Mild and asymptomatic cases are in fact the #1 cause of spread. That's the point. People with mild cases don't even know they have it so they aren't necessarily as careful about wearing masks, being around others.", "sentiment": -0.7281}, {"id": "ge9xk0m", "author": "raddaya", "parent_id": "ge9utmh", "content": "The antibody studies were effectively studies of convenience, drawing from blood donors and/or HCWs, whoever was easily accessible - they specifically were not randomized properly, and they were criticised for this repeatedly. To randomize them, you would need to collect blood samples from volunteers, which would take a very long time for something which is effectively a one-off blood draw (unlike a treatment or vaccine trial) - it doesn't make sense to put that much effort if you can simulate results from a semi-random draw. Though better seroprevalence studies have been done, but anyway.\n\nLarge, decently conducted medical trials are rarely that. A drug trial or a vaccine trial will practically _always_ be properly randomized. Now it's certainly within the realms of possibility that they screwed up - and this will be noticed either in peer review, or by the FDA/EMA/etc during approval - this is one of the things they test for. But in general, it's a _completely_ different kind of study than the antibody studies - them randomizing poorly would be completely shocking and ruin the reputations of everyone involved completely.\n\n> . Mild covid can still cause long term complications. Mild and asymptomatic cases are in fact the #1 cause of spread.\n\n1) The primary aim of the vaccines is to prevent severe infection and deaths. This is obviously where they'll have the strongest data; the other data is still promising but less strong, and it's impossible for it to be strong without testing every participant ever weak (which apparently Oxford did in the UK, but won't be doing in the US.) Therefore, even if the vaccine reduced symptoms and did nothing else, they've already done what they want to. But on top of that, participants have to keep weekly medical diaries and get tested - missing mild cases is again unlikely under these conditions.\n\n2) That statement is just misleading at best; the long term complications of covid have been shown to be heavily correlated to the severity of infection. And no, _presymptomatic_ spread is the major threat; those who are completely asymptomatic spread it very very little compared to presymptomatic or those with symptoms [(source)](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/jz87nd/what_the_data_say_about_asymptomatic_covid/). On top of that, studies in fact show that those with more symptoms are likely to spread more.\n\nSo, that's the bottom line - until and unless someone _actually_ finds a flaw in the randomization, which would be extremely unlikely, it's quite unreasonable to think it's not. But you're perfectly free to wait for a peer review or the FDA to confirm it - nobody's getting injected before that. And EVEN IF despite all the protocols it's missing tons of mild cases (and remember, the medical diaries) - then you still succeeded in your primary aim of stopping severe infections and thus hospitalizations and deaths, therefore turning covid into simply another circulating coronavirus.

If it detects viral RNA in the cytosol, it attaches to a receptor on the mitochondria, preventing the mitochondria from transcribing and replicating any more RNA.  This starts an Interferon 1 response.  INF1 is released outside the surface of the infected cell, some are re-bound to receptors on the cell that released it, some bind to neighboring cells, telling them to slow down any replication going on and to encapsulate anything attempting to come into the cells with special markers to destroy.  \n\n1) Some viruses dump their RNA directly into the cell once it makes contact.  Covid19 is double membraned once it enters the cell (think of a membrane around the entire virus, encapsulating the spikes as well), avoiding detection by roaming RIG-1/MDA5 until it splits open near the mitochondria in an effort to gain access to the replicating apparatus inside.  Since the dsRNA is only exposed for a brief period in the cytosol, detection is lowered.\n\n2) covid19 creates a protease that beats the RIG-1 to the mitochondrial receptor telling the RIG-1 \"everything is ok\" and sends the RIG-1 to go self terminate, allowing free replication.  Blocks the interferon 1 cascade.\n\n3) steals the RNA cap from the host cell RNA, essentially making itself recognized as a friend to the cell.\n\n4) MHC I/II - take viral peptides detected in cytosol up to the surface and hold them up like a hand holding an apple, signaling T-cells that \"I am infected with something, please terminate me\".  In contrast, an empty \"hand\" signals to the T-cell everything is fine.  Covid19 blocks MHC I/II from presenting the antigen.  T-cells eventually recognize that the cell doesnt have as many MHC I/II on the surface as it should have and terminates the cell.\n\n5) since covid19 is almost entirely made of ACE spikes, monocytes in the extracellular space dont recognize it as a threat since other reactions in the body use those same shaped proteins.  \n\nAll the retro viruses have complex innate immune system evasion techniques.

The underlying pathophysiology involves both insulin resistance, which is to a degree reversible, but also pancreatic beta cell destruction, which is not. Even if they're diagnostically \"non-diabetic\", they will not be able to eat and drink like a non-diabetic without reverting back. These underlying mechanisms make them prone to a whole host of complications, including severe infections.\n\n> Sure they include weight loss and dietary changes...\n\nYou realize that's part of what I mean right?

Eventually something hurt while I was doing a lift and I got worried that I slipped a disk. I got a doctors apt and after doing some reflex tests (look up the Bulbocavernosus reflex, it\u2019s a super fun one to have a doctor test) the doc and I agreed about getting a MRI. That came back and I had a 4x4x4 cm tumor growing in the S2 bone of my sacrum. I ended up having treatment at Mass general in Boston since this is a very rare cancer and they have the only specialist center in the world and luckily have been doing some really innovative work there.

How are they going to fight off a disease that attacks their lungs? They already require a lot more oxygen due to their mass, but they're lungs are normal size. Everything they do, they have to work harder to supply oxygen. They probably have weak core muscles too which means that even just breathing under difficult circumstances (say wearing a respirator) will tire them  out faster. Now... Enter an illness that reduces the capacity of their already strained lungs to do their job. It's not going to go well.\n\nI used to be obese and reality out of shape, just a mere 18 months ago.

It just means obesity was not a selection category in this data.\n\nI was responding to a poster asserting the list might as well include everyone because obesity includes a lot of Americans. While that's certainly true and obesity *might* be correlated with worse CV19 outcomes, it's not a factor in this data or the headline result of only 1.8% of NY fatalities having no comorbidities. I posted above the numbers from Italy and only 0.8% of their fatalities have no comorbities. They also don't include obesity as a criteria which is good because otherwise we couldn't compare the numbers. With the stats being only 1% different between NY and Italy, they are consistent and supportive of each other. The 1% variance is so small that it's likely due to slightly varying definitions on selection criteria instead of some fundamental difference that would indicate \"CV19 is killing healthy people more in the US than elsewhere\".", "sentiment": -0.8462}, {"id": "fm8j6dg", "author": "WhyLisaWhy", "parent_id": "fm8hz5s", "content": "Ah ok, I misunderstood.

The [study you cite most frequently](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32196678) looks at 11 cases. So you'll forgive me if I'm more inclined to trust the CDC and NIH guidance, which say asthmatics should be extremely cautious. There are also [other reports](https://wgntv.com/news/medical-watch/medication-may-make-covid-19-worse-for-asthmatics-study-shows/) that suggest that corticosteroids used as maintenance meds could make covid-19 infection worse (though I can't find the journal article - may not have been released yet, since the news release was 2 days ago). The [ACAAI says there's insufficient evidence either way as far as likelihood of infection, but that asthma may cause more severe disease if you are infected](https://acaai.org/news/important-covid-19-information-those-asthma-andor-allergies). \n\nMy point is, there's not any harm in asthmatics being more cautious and assuming they're part of a higher-risk group. We simply do not have enough data to actually assess the risk to asthmatics at the moment. My husband and I have both been diagnosed with asthma in the past and would show up as asthmatic on these types of studies. He hasn't had an asthma attack since childhood, while I've been battling asthma-related chronic bronchitis for the past 10 years.

It's much easier to identify e.g. obesity, or even heart disease, based on autopsy or physical appearance and blood work. Asthma doesn't really show up on bloodwork, and it doesn't necessarily show physically until you're in the middle of an attack... but the evidence of that would probably be covered up by the much more serious symptoms of COVID-19.

I've done enough database matches to know that much. \n\nThere will be time later to go through and do more exhaustive case histories of the people who died in this epidemic.

All excess mortality is in the 65+ year group - every other age group is below average excess mortality. So if CV19 is so bad, why doesn't it look way worse than the same period in a flu epidemic?\n\nBecause there is a quarantine in effect that is bringing the number of not only COVID-19 but the flu cases down. That would be my best guess in absence of any other data point. You are unable to convincingly explain why the hospitals are being overrun worse than in any other recent flu season even when excess mortality is down as you pointed out.\n\nAll you have provided are anecdotes without any data and your claim is that the deaths in Italy are largely the result of the measures taken by the government to prevent COVID-19 from spreading and not CPOVID-19 itself. However the vast majority of the epidemiological data shows that not to be true  as COVID-19 patients did require more use of vents and ICU beds than ever before and the rate of increase in infection has nothing to do with any of the anecdotes you mentioned. \n\n> \u201eIn recent weeks, most of the Eastern European nurses who worked 24 hours a day, 7 days a week supporting people in need of care in Italy have left the country in a hurry. This is not least because of the panic-mongering and the curfews and border closures threatened by the \u201eemergency governments\u201c. As a result, old people in need of care and disabled people, some without relatives, were left helpless by their carers.\n\nYou will need to provide hard data and evidence for this being the cause of increased deaths or the near collapse of Italian hospitals.

I could equally ask you why France is below average mortality during a pandemic of a 'deadly virus' which has apparently killed 5,000 French people.  What you're basically saying is, quarantine, which is what, preventing accidents, so this is only as bad as accidents?  Please provide a source for affect of quarantine on excess mortality.

Chronic disease epidemiology was my jam, but I work in oncology now. \n\nLosing weight is by far the best thing to be doing right now, so keep it up! I forget the exact numbers now but it's something like every 5% of weight you lose will drop your blood pressure by some points - sorry I forget the details but it's very easy to see charted out. So that's the big priority for sure.\n\nFor the rest of the class we'd focus on diet, exercise, and sleep/stress relief. Look up the DASH diet which has recommendations for diet changes beneficial to blood pressure. High level summary - watch your intake of processed/boxed food items, get lots of colorful fruit and veg, high fiber intake, etc. The stuff we've all been told before. I will say DASH recommends a higher carb intake than I personally eat (I'm not low carb by any means, we just don't eat stuff like pasta much), so feel free to tweak it with either a little more in protein or swap some carbs with some EVOO which is quite delicious. Fatty fish is great, nuts and seeds are good snacks but easy to overeat so just watch the calories. \n\nNext is exercise, but don't feel the need to overdo it. The AHA recommends 150 minutes of moderate activity a week - this can be as easy as going for a walk, gardening, cleaning your house! Take a 20 minute walk after dinner every day and you're at 140 minutes right there.\n\nFinally, work on your sleep habits. Have a routine before bed, get your 7-8 hours a night. Avoid caffeine too late in the evening. No screens before bed. And if you are someone prone to stress I highly recommend doing a few minutes of meditation or body scans a day. Stress and blood pressure go hand in hand. I would have participants take their BP, do a 5-10 minute meditation, then take it again and their score would drop a lot.

Public health measures that can reduce the risk of infection and death in addition to quarantines are desperately needed. This article reviews the roles of vitamin D in reducing the risk of respiratory tract infections, knowledge about the epidemiology of influenza and COVID-19, and how vitamin D supplementation might be a useful measure to reduce risk. Through several mechanisms, vitamin D can reduce risk of infections. Those mechanisms include inducing cathelicidins and defensins that can lower viral replication rates and reducing concentrations of pro-inflammatory cytokines that produce the inflammation that injures the lining of the lungs, leading to pneumonia, as well as increasing concentrations of anti-inflammatory cytokines. Several observational studies and clinical trials reported that vitamin D supplementation reduced the risk of influenza, whereas others did not. Evidence supporting the role of vitamin D in reducing risk of COVID-19 includes that the outbreak occurred in winter, a time when 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) concentrations are lowest; that the number of cases in the Southern Hemisphere near the end of summer are low; that vitamin D deficiency has been found to contribute to acute respiratory distress syndrome; and that case-fatality rates increase with age and with chronic disease comorbidity, both of which are associated with lower 25(OH)D concentration. To reduce the risk of infection, it is recommended that people at risk of influenza and/or COVID-19 consider taking 10,000 IU/d of vitamin D3 for a few weeks to rapidly raise 25(OH)D concentrations, followed by 5000 IU/d. The goal should be to raise 25(OH)D concentrations above 40-60 ng/mL (100-150 nmol/L). For treatment of people who become infected with COVID-19, higher vitamin D3 doses might be useful.

IPD were obtained for 10\u2009933 (96.6%) participants. Vitamin D supplementation reduced the risk of acute respiratory tract infection among all participants (adjusted odds ratio 0.88, 95% confidence interval 0.81 to 0.96; P for heterogeneity <0.001). In subgroup analysis, protective effects were seen in those receiving daily or weekly vitamin D without additional bolus doses (adjusted odds ratio 0.81, 0.72 to 0.91) but not in those receiving one or more bolus doses (adjusted odds ratio 0.97, 0.86 to 1.10; P for interaction=0.05). Among those receiving daily or weekly vitamin D, protective effects were stronger in those with baseline 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels <25 nmol/L (adjusted odds ratio 0.30, 0.17 to 0.53) than in those with baseline 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels \u226525 nmol/L (adjusted odds ratio 0.75, 0.60 to 0.95; P for interaction=0.006). Vitamin D did not influence the proportion of participants experiencing at least one serious adverse event (adjusted odds ratio 0.98, 0.80 to 1.20, P=0.83). The body of evidence contributing to these analyses was assessed as being of high quality.\n\n**Conclusions**\u00a0Vitamin D supplementation was safe and it protected against acute respiratory tract infection overall.

I had moved to a different city and so my doctor on evaluation was happy with the progress . I told him I had never gotten any maintenance doses but at this point with my levels, he said I din't need any. I was okay with that because I didn't need overdosage either. My aches and pains were gone for a whole 9 months at this point and I was at least 50% less tired than before. I was given a Vitamin B12 supplement for 3 months at this point. All was good again!\n\nIn December 2019, I was evaluated again. I had moved to a third city at this point. The levels were 34. The third doctor said I didn't need any supplementation at this point.

From the Broward PDF:\n\n> Severity of pulmonary involvement was assessed at the time of initiation of therapy (\u201conset\u201d) and categorized as severe or non-severe. \n\n> Patients were considered to have severe pulmonary involvement if they required an FiO2 of 50% or greater, high-flow nasal oxygen, noninvasive ventilation, or intubation and mechanical ventilation. \n\n> The non-severe pulmonary criteria encompassed patients who required no supplemental oxygen, or \u201clow FIO2\u201d (ie: Venturi mask 40% or less, or any amount of low flow nasal cannula), independent of radiographic or laboratory findings.\n\nFor IVM, *some* of the \"severe\" patients were on ventilators, but others weren't. For DEX, the less-severe group is \"patients needing oxygen\", versus two categories for IVM, \"high-flow\" (severe) and \"low FI02\" (not severe). For IVM, the less-severe group includes patients that do *not* need *any* oxygen supplementation.\n\nMaybe both DEX groups can be merged into one comparable to the IVM severe group? How do we merge the DEX results, though, without knowing how many patients were in each of the DEX groups?!\n\nAnother factor is how the Broward fatality rate is so high compared to the DEX study: the with-IVM fatality rate (38.8%) is about the same as the without-DEX fatality rate (40%), the latter for patients on *ventilators*. The without-IVM Broward fatality rate was 80.7%!!! \n\nAre the Broward patients a lot older? Broward *is* in southern Florida, retirement heaven. Given the mean age 59.6 years and standard deviation 17.9, if a normal curve is applicable (doubtful) then the Broward age distribution looks like [this](https://i.imgur.com/vrEWS8W.png).\n\n<time lapse>\n\nI can't find any details about the subjects of this study, so I can't speculate about age differences between the two studies.\n\nReaching for a conclusion:\n\nThrough my ivermectin-colored glasses, ivermectin seems superior given:  \n\n1) IVM's 52% lower mortality rate for the most severe patients (80.7% -> 38.8%) vs the 30% reduction for DEX's ventilator group (40% -> 28%).  \n\n2) Despite the \"not severe\" Broward group probably being healthier, esp. some do not require any oxygen supplementation (at intake), the overall Broward mortality rate dropped 40% (25.2% -> 15.0%) which is better than DEX's strongest result, the 30% drop for ventilator patients.  \n \n3) For DEX's healthier (no ventilator) patients, the rate dropped only 20% (25% -> 20%) -- *half* of the overall Broward result (40%) which included severe and non-severe patients.  \n\nTrying for the overall DEX mortality, if we assume that DEX had 5 times as many non-ventilator patients as ventilator patients, then this might calculate the weighted change in mortality:\n\n(5/6 * (20 / 25)) + (1/6 * (28 / 40)) = .783\n\nmeaning DEX reduced the overall fatality rate by 21.7% -- just over *half* of the overall IVM reduction (40%).\n\nIs my math correct? I got 800 on the math GRE -- in 1977. The little gray cells do not work as well as they used to.\n\nWhat do you think? Did ivermectin show stronger results in the Broward study?

This makes me immediately believe that there are quite a few confounding variables that could lead to differing results. I mean, even after treatment with ivermectin, the fatality rate barely reached that of the control group in the dexamethasone study.\n\nSo until there are studies on a comparable cohort in a similar location, I think it is difficult to make direct comparisons.\n\nIf the patients and standard-of-care provided are truly comparable, then that would lead us to believe that treatment with dexamethasone led to a mortality rate of 28% compared to 39% with ivermectin. Which would make dexamethasone superior. But again, these sorts of direct comparisons are baseless.\n\nAssuming the cohorts are not comparable between studies, and the Dexamethasone study location has a better standard-of-care and therefore lower base fatality rate, then the smaller absolute reduction in mortality by finding an effective treatment is obviously expected. If dexamethasone on its own brings mortality down to 20%, then whether you start at an 80% or 40% mortality rate is going to make it more or less impressive.\n\nIf I begin with an 80% base mortality rate, and give those patients dexamethasone instead of ivermectin, who's to say that the mortality wouldn't go even lower than the 39% observed for ivermectin?\n\nThis isn't to say that dexamethasone is superior to ivermectin.

I dropped a few references below (because I can recall them extemporaneously.) that show how the literature doesn't point clearly toward efficacy.   It'll take me a little longer to track down COVID-19 specific literature. (I've read a good deal of it, but haven't had a chance to organize what I've read.). \n\nFor the record, I do think glucocorticoids have a role in treatment of COVID-19 (and probably sepsis and ARDS), however they are powerful, but fairly crude tools with nasty adverse effect profiles. How glucocorticoids (and dexamethasone specifically) are used probably matters. I'm sympathetic to pulse treatment, stopping when it appears that the inflammatory response is calming. (Measured by reduced O2 requirement, possibly D-dimer/CRP/ESR etc.) However, injudicious use is likely to cause harm (which my read of the RCT data of parallel clinical problems (sepsis/ARDS) suggests.) \n\n>Can you source that too? Glucocorticoids are used quite widely in ICU in my experience.\n\nThe ATS reading list has a few links that may help clarify.(Note: This is by no means exhaustive, just illustrative.)\n\n For instance:\n\nhttps://www.thoracic.org/professionals/career-development/residents-medical-students/ats-reading-list/adult/\n\n**In ARDS:**\nSteinberg KP, Hudson LD, Goodman RB, et al. Efficacy and safety of corticosteroids for persistent acute respiratory distress syndrome. N Engl J Med 2006; 354:1671-84. This study randomized 180 patients with persistent ARDS (7 to 28 days after onset) to methylprednisolone (daily dose 2 mg/kg x 14 days then 1 mg/kg x 7 days) vs. placebo. **Hospital mortality and 180-day survival were comparable, but patients enrolled 14 or more days after ARDS onset had increased 60-day mortality (35% vs. 8% placebo, p = .02).**\n\nMeduri GU, Golden E, Freire AX, et al. Methylprednisolone infusion in early severe ARDS: results of a randomized controlled trial. Chest 2007; 131:954-63. This study of 91 patients with severe ARDS added fuel to the debate over systemic corticosteroid use in ARDS. The intervention group received steroids within 72 hours of ARDS diagnosis and a slow taper. **Steroid recipients had decreased duration of mechanical ventilation and ICU stay.** The higher proportion of patients with catecholamine-dependent shock among controls, cross over from control to steroids in \u201cnonresponders\u201d at day 7, and 2:1 randomization of treatment to control are among the concerns raised since its publication.\n\n**In Sepsis**\n\nVenkatesh B, Finfer S, Cohen J et al. Adjunctive glucocorticoid therapy in patients with septic shock. N Engl J Med. 2018; 378:797-808. From 2013 - 2017, the ADRENAL trial randomized 3,800 patients with septic shock receiving mechanical ventilation to receive hydrocortisone (at a dose of 200 mg per day via continuous infusion) or placebo for 7 days or until death or ICU discharge. **There was no difference in 90-day mortality (near 28% for both groups). The steroid group spent less time on vasopressors but duration of ICU stay and days free of mechanical ventilation did not differ.**\n\n>this pretty much outranks any other data we have on the matter.\n\nI'd like to push back epistemically against the idea that RCTs \"outrank\" other forms of knowledge.\n\nRCTs have a number of useful features: Randomization is a hedge against confounding so they have good internal validity. The problem is their external validity is generally not as good because they tend to be small, study specific populations (that may be heterogenous), and ask fairly narrow questions. In my opinion, extrapolation to different populations and similar, but not identical clinical questions must be done thoughtfully, incorporating other trial data, cohort data, and physiology. \n\nIf your patient population doesn't look like the study's population the study results may not be applicable. Similarly, if both the intervention and placebo group's care differs from usual care in one's own institution, it's hard to know if the effect is a result of the the intervention, an interaction with the difference in care and the intervention or an inappropriate control group. \n\n(This is my initial concern with this papers result. Neither the statistical data I've seen, nor my own clinical experience suggests that 13% of hospitalized COVID-19 patients without an O2 requirement die. I haven't witnessed anything that approaches this. (None of my own patients without an O2 requirement have died, for instance.) Why is this happening to the control group of this trial? \n\nAnother challenge concerns heterogenous study populations (like this one). It's not clear if a small subpopulation is enjoying a large effect size or the whole population is enjoying a smaller one. Sometimes, subgroup analysis can clarify this, but this presumes that the authors frame their question correctly and aren't missing an unconsidered parameter.\n\nIn short, RCTs are great, but need to be interpreted in the setting of what we already know. They should update our prior odds, but not reset them.\n\n\nEdit: \nA source defending that 13% mortality is surprisingly high for COVID-19 patients that do not require respiratory support: \n\n(https://www.mayoclinicproceedings.org/article/S0025-6196(20)30367-0/pdf) \" Thirty-five of 51 patients (68.63%) with SpO2 values of 90% or less after oxygen supplementation did not survive, whereas 88 of 89 (98.9%) of those with SpO2 values greater than 90% did survive (log-rank P<.001)\"\n\n\nSupport for the statement that the adverse effects of glucocorticoids can increase mortality of ICU patients: (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22732293/)\n\n\" systemic corticosteroids should be used very cautiously because this treatment is strongly associated with increased risk of death in patients with intensive care unit-acquired pneumonia, particularly in the absence of established indications and in patients with lower baseline severity. \"", "sentiment": 0.926}, {"id": "fv0ocrs", "author": "DNAhelicase", "parent_id": "fv0b3up", "content": "Your comment is unsourced speculation [Rule 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/about/rules/).

Because lovenox doesn't do swell with metal valves and he's at high risk, he's back on warfarin with a target INR between 3-3.5, plavix and aspirin. No DOACSs.

He listed the symptoms as fever, digestive problems and vascular inflammation.\n\nAt least three children in the US aged six months to eight years are being treated for a similar condition. Mark Gorelik, a specialist treating the patients at Columbia University Medical Center in New York, said all had fever and inflammation of the heart and gut. \u201cRight now, we\u2019re at the very beginning of trying to understand what that represents,\u201d he told Reuters. Gorelik believes the cases are not Kawasaki disease but a similar condition that shares a common cause, namely an infectious agent that triggers an immune response.The three New York cases follow a report from Stanford University in California, in which a 6-month-old was admitted to hospital with Kawasaki disease and was later diagnosed with coronavirus.\n\nMany of the children having treatment for the new syndrome have tested positive for coronavirus, but others have not. That could mean that the syndrome is not related to coronavirus, that the children had cleared the virus before they were tested, or that the test missed the infection.\n\nSome doctors suspect the syndrome is a \u201cpost-infection inflammatory response\u201d where the immune system overreacts in the wake of an infection. This would suggest that in some children the disease has two phases \u2013 the initial infection and a secondary immune response that takes hold later.\n\nDr Nazima Pathan, a consultant in paediatric intensive care in Cambridge, said the number of children admitted to intensive care units with Covid-19 was relatively low, but that some were presenting with what looked like toxic shock syndrome and Kawasaki disease. \u201cThese children have had a severe and prolonged inflammatory response to Covid-19 infection and they have not had severe lung disease, unlike the majority of cases in adults,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cWhilst this is an evolving situation, it is clear that these symptoms are reported in only handfuls of cases,\u201d Pathan added. \u201cThe important message is that if parents are worried about their children\u2019s health, they should seek medical advice.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe new syndrome, which has yet to be named, dominated discussion between leading doctors on a teleconference about Covid-19 in children hosted on Tuesday by the World [Health](https://www.theguardian.com/society/health) Organization.\n\nThe first known cases in Britain emerged three to four weeks ago, but doctors now plan to look over the medical records of children in intensive care earlier this year to check whether earlier cases were missed.\"", "sentiment": 0.9442}, {"id": "fp9ootb", "author": "Woodenswing69", "parent_id": "fp9o3cq", "content": "Hmm thanks.

As you get more clotting you increase the risk of clumps of platelets breaking off and floating in the blood stream, these will either be broken down by the body or can get stuck somewhere else.  If a few of these combined and get big enough that larger clump could get stuck somewhere important causing a stroke, heart attack etc  that kills you.  This would explain why we are seeing tons of \"mini-clot\" throughout the lungs, some of these break off and then its a bit of a luck game if your body breaks it down or if it grows and blocks something important. \n\n\nthe source that u/dadealeus provides argues something kinda similar.  He argues that as part of the immune response to COVID the body is releasing histamine.  Histamine is normal, but in allergies you have too much of it and that causes problems.  So as the pneumonia progresses you get histamine release and a lack of oxygen caused by the pnemonia (this isn't the histamine causing the lack of oxygen like it would in a severe peanut allergy).  He argues that these 2 factors cause a net over-release of a clotting factor (or technically, its corresponding anti-coagulant gets \"exhausted\" first, your body stops releasing is sooner than it release the clotting factor).  So you have an increase in the clotting factor in your blood, which causes platelets to start adhering to each other and that causes the clots we are seeing.  There's a few jumps in there that I had issues with but I don't know enough to just say no so I'm still looking through the literature a bit to see if all those make sense.\n\nThe problem I have with both of these is that anecdotally our measures of clotting seem to be higher in covid patients than other pneumonia patients.  So to me it feels like both of these explanations don't explain why COVID specifically is causing this (yes the youtube video makes the HP argument but doesn't explain why covid is unique).  Of course it could be we aren't used to seeing this many pneumonia patients and the prevalence isn't actually higher it just seems to be because there are so many more cases we are seeing.", "sentiment": -0.9695}, {"id": "fp9tj45", "author": "marsloversonearth", "parent_id": "fp9nkzg", "content": "Interesting!

There has been an outbreak of \"lycan disease\" and people are turning into hairy beasts full of rage. What's the first first thing that everyone reaches for? [Silver bullets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver_bullet) because although it's expensive and a very niche solution, it's is effective against werewolf like creatures. \n\nBut somewhere along the way, we make a discovery. From a few observations:\n\n* Jane and Thomas were walking back from the orchard and encountered a werewolf and somehow it didn't attack them. \n* Ol' Betty Sue was baking a pie and a werewolf that entered her house left without killing her.\n* Mysteriously, no teachers in the city have been killed.\n\nSo someone starts to wonder what these all have in common. And an insightful physician says, \"they were all eating apples!\". And so the villagers' physicians come up with a (horrific) test: Let's give the *some* of the orphans in Saint Anne's School apples with every meal and allow them to play outside; and let's give some of the orphans tarts instead. To be semi-random, orphans born in even years get apples and the ones born in odd years get tarts. No trading allowed!\n\nSo the study began, but while it was ongoing, the smith and the jeweler kept on supplying silver bullets to the villagers!\n\nWell, after four weeks, the physicians check the experiment's progress. They discover that zero orphans in the apple eating group were killed, and only one was maimed though not turned. And 8 in the tart eating group were killed and another 5 were infected with lycan disease. \n\nThe hypothesis has been validated: An apple a day keeps the werewolves away!\n\nOf course, there are a few cynical and conspiratorial villagers in the bunch. They ask aloud, \"Why were *silver bullets* pushed back in the beginning!? Everyone knows *an apple a day* is the answer!\" Others among them suggest that it's the village jeweler and smith conspiring to profiteer off of the outbreak of lycan disease. It seems so obvious...\n\nBut again, turning to the record, we are reminded that no one knew that eating apples prevented one from being attacked by werewolves. They're conflating the adage of \"an apple a day keeps the doctor away\" and the general idea that apples are good and healthy with the specific fact established by recent observations and experiments that apples have a specific effect in preventing lycan disease.\n\nBut because everyone's under a lot of stress with the whole werewolf thing, and people are looking for targets to blame... it's somehow easier to believe that the jeweler and the smith, who really were just trying to help, somehow were suppressing a better alternative. But the truth is that the villagers had no alternative! And even long after the apple news was discovered, the town still needed to keep a stock of silver bullets because they were effective!\n\n***", "sentiment": -0.3987}, {"id": "ge54kze", "author": "darknessdown", "parent_id": "ge51kh2", "content": "Woah that was simultaneously really impressive and more than a little off putting", "sentiment": 0.5563}, {"id": "ge52cqx", "author": "MurphysLab", "parent_id": "ge51kh2", "content": "## Back to COVID Science\n\nSo, let's get back to COVID-19 now. At the beginning of the pandemic, no one had any clue that vitamin D was playing such a big role in modulating the effects of the disease on individuals. \n\nWhen you are faced with some new, partially unknown problem, you start with solutions to similar problems. In this case, we know that COVID-19 is a (corona)virus, so for *severe* cases, you treat them with a [**broad-spectrum antiviral drug**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broad-spectrum_antiviral_drug):\n\n> Broad-spectrum antiviral drugs (or broad-spectrum antiviral agents, BSAA) are a class of antiviral drugs, which target and inhibit the replication and development of a broad range of viral pathogens. BSAAs work by inhibiting viral proteins (such as polymerases, proteases, or reverse transcriptases) or by targeting host cell proteins and processes exploited by the virus during infection.\n\n> Many BSAs are found showing efficacy against a given virus outside their original indication, showing antiviral activity against other viruses than originally investigated (such as remdesivir and ritonavir/lopinavir) or outside their original therapeutic indications [...]. This makes BSAs potential candidates for drug repurposing. Repurposing of BSAs will allow for quicker, cheaper and more efficient development of antivirals than de novo drug development.\n\nAnti-viral drugs are targeted at viruses, much as silver bullets are targeted for werewolves. The problem here is that with COVID-19, lots of these broad-spectrum anti-viral drugs weren't working effectively. And that was despite through repeated, *desperate* trying!  Here's an early review from May that looked at a bunch of them:\n\n> Evolving research and clinical data regarding the virologic SARS-CoV-2 suggest a potential list of repurposed drugs with appropriate pharmacological effects and therapeutic efficacies in treating COVID-19 patients. In this review, we will update and summarize the most common and plausible drugs for the treatment of COVID-19 patients. These drugs and therapeutic agents include antiviral agents (remdesivir, hydroxychloroquine, chloroquine, lopinavir, umifenovir, favipiravir, and oseltamivir), and supporting agents (Ascorbic acid, Azithromycin, Corticosteroids, Nitric oxide, IL-6 antagonists), among others. We hope that this review will provide useful and most updated therapeutic drugs to prevent, control, and treat COVID-19 patients until the approval of vaccines and specific drugs targeting SARS-CoV-2.\n\n> An Update on Current Therapeutic Drugs Treating COVID-19, Curr Pharmacol Rep. 2020 May 11 : 1\u201315.\n\n> https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7211915/\n\nRead through that review! At that point, it seemed that the only one that was reported to be effective was  [Remdesivir](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remdesivir). Moreover, subsequent research has *partially* upheld that early finding:\n\n\n> BACKGROUND\n\n> Although several therapeutic agents have been evaluated for the treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19), no antiviral agents have yet been shown to be efficacious.\n\n> CONCLUSIONS\n\n> Our data show that remdesivir was superior to placebo in shortening the time to recovery in adults who were hospitalized with Covid-19 and had evidence of lower respiratory tract infection. \n\n> \"Remdesivir for the Treatment of Covid-19 \u2014 Final Report\", The New England Journal of Medicine, November 5, 2020\n\n> https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2007764\n\nBut that's why remdesivir became the drug of choice. Not because of its price, but because it had early evidence of efficacy when many other treatments did not.\n\n***\n\n**Edit:** I should make clear that remdesivir is no longer the drug of choice, per the World Health Organization, as larger studies have shown a relatively weak effect, if any. The WHO's recommendation was updated recently in light of those studies, in favour of corticosteroid treatments:\n\n\n> **Recommendations:** The panel made a conditional recommendation against the use of remdesivir in hospitalized\npatients with COVID-19, regardless of disease severity. This guidance adds to recommendations published in the\nprevious version: a strong recommendation for systemic corticosteroids in patients with severe and critical COVID19, and a conditional recommendation against systemic corticosteroids in patients with non-severe COVID-19.\n\n> https://apps.who.int/iris/handle/10665/336729 ([PDF](https://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/336729/WHO-2019-nCov-remdesivir-2020.1-eng.pdf))", "sentiment": 0.8088}, {"id": "ge52yq1", "author": "MurphysLab", "parent_id": "ge52cqx", "content": "## What About Vitamin D?\n\nBut along the way as our physicians and scientists are battling this virus, people start looking for trends. And one of those trends was how vitamin D was a big issue. \n\nPerhaps one of the first hints of this issue was the disproportionate effect COVID-19 was having on Black Americans:\n\n\n> In the USA, early data suggest that African Americans are disproportionately affected by COVID-19. In a preliminary study of data compiled from hospitals in 14 US states, African Americans represented 33% of COVID-19 hospitalisations, despite only making up 18% of the total population studied. In another analysis, among COVID-19 deaths for which race and ethnicity data were available, death rates from COVID-19 in New York City (NY, USA) among black or African American people (92\u00b73 deaths per 100 000 population) and Hispanic or Latino people (74\u00b73) were substantially higher than that of white (45\u00b72) or Asian (34\u00b75) people. \u201cStudies are underway to confirm these data and understand and potentially reduce the impact of COVID-19 on the health of racial and ethnic minorities\u201d, a spokesperson from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) confirmed to The Lancet Respiratory Medicine.\n\n> \"Evidence mounts on the disproportionate effect of COVID-19 on ethnic minorities\", *The Lancet Respiratory Medicine*, Published:May 08, 2020\n\n> https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanres/article/PIIS2213-2600(20)30228-9/fulltext \n\nSome of this is certainly a result of socioeconomic disparity, but part of the problem is now understood to involve the inherently lower levels of vitamin D present in individuals with dark skin. (cf. \"[Vitamin D deficiency in African Americans is associated with a high risk of severe disease and mortality by SARS-CoV-2](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41371-020-00398-z)\", Journal of Human Hypertension).\n\nBut that was one of many hints of a trend which pointed physicians to say, \"Hey, we really should study the effect of vitamin D levels on this disease\":\n\n> It is posited by contributors [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] to BMJ, \u2018Preventing a covid-19 pandemic\u2019, others, [6, 7, 8] and myself, [9] that vitamin D, and particularly vitamin D deficiency, is a likely factor in the progression, and/ or severity, and/ or mortality of COVID-19; and also may present clinical treatment opportunities.\n\n> My preprint, \u2018Vitamin D deficiency: a factor in COVID-19, progression, severity and mortality? \u2013 An urgent call for research\u2019, [9] posits, greater vitamin D deficiency <25nmol/L in southern (E.g. Spain and Italy), than northern European Countries (E.g. Germany, Norway, Finland, Iceland), may help account for differentials, in mortality rates per million. Consistent with this, Northern Europeans have higher vitamin D food intakes, food fortification, and supplement more. This is an easily testable posit.\n\n> [...]\n\n> Robert A Brown\n\n> 07 April 2020\n\n> https://www.bmj.com/content/368/bmj.m810/rr-46\n\nSo early on physicians and scientists were seeing hints that vitamin D might be involved, but until the studies *confirmed* that, no one knew. Sure, now it feels like \"Well, everyone knows that vitamin D is good for you... they should have tried it\", but the randomness of those who experienced severe symptoms didn't directly communicate that. And there are thousands of possible factors: To check all of them systematically takes ages. We didn't have ages -- we had people dying. \n\nPlus, you can't just throw the everything and the kitchen sink at the patient while at the same time **learning** something. It's why if you're designing an experiment, you're only allowed to change **one variable** at a time. And with squishy biological systems, outcomes aren't as clear cut, so you need lots of patients (but it's a deadly disease, so you can't intentionally make more atients)... so you can only try a few things at once. Where do you put your money? Where it's most likely to win the bet. In science, that involves having a logical nexus to the problem. i.e. Have virus ---> use an antiviral. You can't go trying lavender oil, *because peoples' lives are at risk!*\n\nAnd yes, even [vitamin C was tested](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7211915/) because the researchers had a reason to suspect it might help:\n\n> [...] ***Given this background,*** a phase II clinical trial (NCT04264533) is initiated in China to evaluate high-dose IV vitamin C in ICU patients with severe COVID-19-associated pneumonia [80]. Some hospitals have reported giving infected patients 1500 mg of vitamin C as supportive treatment. High-dose IV vitamin C has been given in the treatment of 50 moderate to severe COVID-19 patients in China [81]. The doses varied between 2 and 10 g per day, given over a period of 8-\u201310-h IV infusion. [...]\n\nBut as science usually goes, there's a bit of serendipity. Someone, perhaps by chance, notices a pattern and looks further. And from that investigation we can discover a mechanism understand not only what works, but why it works. That helped those on the forefront of science to see that vitamin D played a role. And it wasn't until that connection was made that people knew to act. \n\n***\n\nSo that's the end of my (I hope) informative little rant. It isn't some kind of \"big pharma\" conspiracy. It's science and medicine and pharmacology throwing everything that we have at a novel disease... and then, by luck, find something cheap and effective that happens to reduce the severity of the disease.", "sentiment": 0.9928}, {"id": "ge7d3ij", "author": "Z7N6Qo", "parent_id": "ge52yq1", "content": "This is why I visit this sub..

And while you might be able to develop a good understanding of the efficacy of a drug, there's so many connections and contradictions and other factors that you are going to miss. That's why even if we have physicians, we have specialties within medicine: oncology for cancer; surgeons for surgery; dermatologists for skin; etc... Deep expertise takes a long time to develop and that is needed as a foundation for being fully informed. \n\nSo this is a guide to becoming *vaguely* informed. \n\n## **Step 1.** Visit Wikipedia\n\nWikipedia usually provides a basic and usually unbiased summary of a topic. I am not turning to Wikipedia to form an opinion, rather just to get a snapshot showing [*the lay of the land*](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/the%20lay%20of%20the%20land). \n\nOne of the biggest challenges for someone who is approaching a new zone of knowledge is vocabulary. We use words to encapsulate ideas, but if you know the idea and not the word, you are generally powerless to learn more. Knowing the right words is like having a key opening the door to more knowledge. So reading a brief Wikipedia article, and perhaps following a few of the links within, will familiarize you with that new vocabulary. \n\nAdditionally, within Wikipedia we find sources - links to primary articles. So it can be good to follow these to examine what the original article actually says. One can provide a link to a source, which gives information a *superficial appearance of support*, but it's necessary to confirm that the source agrees with what it is used to support.\n\n## **Step 2.** Visit Google Scholar\n\nThe link: https://scholar.google.com/\n\nWe want to know about Ivermectin and COVID-19, so we can search that:\n\nOur search: https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=Ivermectin+and+COVID-19\n\nNow, because this is a rapidly evolving area of science and medicine, one needs to be cautious and pay attention to the context of each article. \n\n* Is the article published in a peer-reviewed journal? Be very cautious about non-peer-reviewed publications:\n  * News stories\n  * Press releases\n  * Preprints\n* Where is the article published? \n  * Is it a reputable journal? \n  * Does it have an Impact Factor? \n  * If you aren't sure, try sticking with PubMed - https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=covid-19\n* Who published the article? If it's by professors, they usually have a profile on a university web page. But physicians often don't. \n* Is there a known conflict of interest?\n* What kind of article is this? **Reviews and meta-analysis papers are often the best to go to if you are not an expert!** However they come at a later stage in the overall progress of scientific research. \n  * Study\n  * Meta-Analysis\n  * Review\n  * Letters & Commentary\n* Was the study registered in advance? There should be a statement pointing to clinicaltrials.gov or a similar agency.\n* How is the drug being used? (e.g. prophylaxis / preventative, or treatment of those infected, or for those with severe disease)\n* How large was the study? Bigger studies are less likely to be skewed by random effects. (see: [funnel plots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Funnel_plot))\n* When was the article published? Early articles tend to be more speculative, so again more caution. \n* Look at what's most cited. Again, earlier ones will be cited more often, but given to papers published in the same timeframe, generally more *compelling* ones are cited more frequently. Google Scholar shows rough citation counts, so this can help you to see what has generated the most discussion. Beware of early stuff! \n\nAlso, note that you can click on those citation numbers and get a list of articles cite that paper. This can be very useful to check to see if some promising early result was later confirmed to be effective. \n\nBut it isn't enough to look at just those factors... you have to read the papers.\n\n## **Step 3.** Organize a List of Articles!\n\nOrganize your literature survey. Since this is an area that's happened essentially all within 1 year, a chronological ordering will probably be best, since it allows us to see the genesis of the idea and how perspectives have evolved among experts.\n\n## **Step 4.** Read Several Papers\n\nIdeally, you read several papers, in full. And from those, you can come up with a list of which other papers you should read, because now you have the context of citations. \n\nBut chances are high that you don't have a ton of time. So you skim the papers' content. (Remember: you've already looked at the previously described factors)\n\nSkimming:\n\n1. Read the title. What is the focus?\n2. Read the abstract. For medical papers, these are often well laid out with separate sections, mirroring the full paper, e.g.:\n  * Background\n  * Methods\n  * Results\n  * Conclusions\n3. Skim the paper\n   * Read the conclusions\n   * Then read the results\n   * Look at the data\n4. If you feel it's a worthwhile paper, read it in full, start to end. \n\n***\n\n## **What would I read on this topic?**\n\nHere's a brief (quick and dirty) outline with some of the main papers that I've found, in chronological order (by date of first publication in journals):\n\n* 2020 Apr 3 : \"The FDA-approved drug ivermectin inhibits the replication of SARS-CoV-2 in vitro\" : https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32251768/\n  * Note that this title is a bit misleading.

I've done a lot of Steps 1, 3 and 4 over the past 9 months for multiple drugs, but not in an organised manner. I'm a layman and so technically my opinion has no value. \n\nI've followed ivermectin (because cheap and safe, as I live in India where we need cheap and safe as much as effective) since the Monash university in-vitro study, the recanted Lancet observational study paper (Amit Patel et al), the Chaccour debunking of ivermectin claims in the Lancet paper, the subsequent adoption of ivermectin by the Marik protocol, the Broward County Florida study, the dozen or so trials at clinicaltrials.gov (all suffering from small sizes ; not-so-respected / not-well-known universities/hospitals), the repeated success stories from Bangladesh, the studies from Egypt, Iraq, India and the couple of RCTs that seem OK. The question that bothers me is the absence of a large proper RCT in a western country, especially given that ivermectin is not prescribed wholesale to the public like it is in South America and South Asia. Meanwhile, there are very detailed illustrative videos about the mechanism of ivermectin reducing the replication of the virus and helping fight the inflammation response too. Not that I understand much, just that one particular part of the ivermectin molecule blocks the cell mechanism of virus replication once the virus has entered the cell.\n\nGiven all this, I find the lack of interest in conducting a large-scale RCT in western countries surprising. We already have the vaccines by now, so maybe it's not commerically feasible or medically that exciting to do an ivermectin RCT, but given the longevity of the pandemic, it is worth every bit for someone to do a 500+ sized RCT with ivermectin as prophylaxis and mild-stage outpatient intervention at least. If not in the ICU (where observational studies and reports have also shown benefits).\n\nAgain, thank you very much for taking the time to explain all that.

But let me tell you a story.\n> \n> One of my patients ran into the Ambien Walrus the other day and so, make a long story short, she needed a new sleeping pill. She was on a lot of drugs at the time and not all that healthy, and every drug I could think of, the pharmacist had some good reason why that would be a terrible idea in her case.

Given the dynamics of the COVID-19 pandemic, rational vitamin D supplementation whose safety has been proven in an extensive body of research should be promoted and initiated to limit the toll of the pandemic even before the final proof of efficacy in preventing COVID-19 deaths by randomized trials.\n> \n> We read, with great interest, the recent article by Radujkovic et al. that reported associations between vitamin D deficiency (25(OH)D < 12 ng/mL) or insufficiency (25(OH)D < 20 ng/mL) and death in a cohort of 185 consecutive symptomatic SARS-CoV-2-positive patients admitted to the Medical University Hospital Heidelberg, who were diagnosed and treated between 18 March and 18 June 2020 [[1](https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/12/12/3642/htm#B1-nutrients-12-03642)]. In this cohort, 118 patients (64%) had vitamin D insufficiency at recruitment (including 41 patients with vitamin D deficiency), and 16 patients died of the infection. With a covariate-adjusted relative risk of death of 11.3, mortality was much higher among vitamin D insufficient patients than among other patients. When translated to the proportion of deaths in the population that is statistically attributable to vitamin D insufficiency (\u201cpopulation attributable risk proportion\u201d), a key measure of public health relevance of risk factors [[2](https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/12/12/3642/htm#B2-nutrients-12-03642)], these results imply that 87% of COVID-19 deaths may be statistically attributed to vitamin D insufficiency and could potentially be avoided by eliminating vitamin D insufficiency.\n> \n> Although results of an observational study, such as this one, need to be interpreted with caution, as done by the authors [[1](https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/12/12/3642/htm#B1-nutrients-12-03642)], due to the potential of residual confounding or reverse causality (i.e., vitamin D insufficiency resulting from poor health status at baseline rather than vice versa), it appears extremely unlikely that such a strong association in this prospective cohort study could be explained this way, in particular as the authors had adjusted for age, sex and comorbidity as potential confounders in their multivariate analysis. There are also multiple plausible mechanisms that may well explain the observed associations, such as increased concentrations of pro-inflammatory cytokines, as well as decreased concentrations of anti-inflammatory cytokines in vitamin D insufficiency [[3](https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/12/12/3642/htm#B3-nutrients-12-03642),[4](https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/12/12/3642/htm#B4-nutrients-12-03642)]. Although final proof of causality and prevention of deaths by vitamin D supplementation would have to come from randomized trials which meanwhile have been initiated (e.g., [[5](https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/12/12/3642/htm#B5-nutrients-12-03642)]), the results of such trials will not be available in the short run. Given the dynamics of the COVID-19 pandemic and the proven safety of vitamin D supplementation, it therefore appears highly debatable and potentially even unethical to await results of such trials before public health action is taken. Besides other population-wide measures of prevention, widespread vitamin D3 supplementation at least for high-risk groups, such as older adults or people with relevant comorbidity, which has been proven by randomized controlled trials to be beneficial with respect to prevention of other acute respiratory infections and acute acerbation of asthma and chronic pulmonary disease [[6](https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/12/12/3642/htm#B6-nutrients-12-03642),[7](https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/12/12/3642/htm#B7-nutrients-12-03642),[8](https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/12/12/3642/htm#B8-nutrients-12-03642),[9](https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/12/12/3642/htm#B9-nutrients-12-03642),[10](https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/12/12/3642/htm#B10-nutrients-12-03642)], should be promoted.

Nobody has ever demonstrated a verifiable reason for the seasonality of respiratory infections.   If low humidity and a high propensity for staying indoors were causatory, we'd expect to see influenza outbreaks through most of the Southwest USA and Australia in the summer (and we don't).  Additionally, we frequently see outbreaks in places that have high humidity in the winter months.  Vitamin D very well could constitute the main reason for the seasonality, but we just don't have enough data one way or the other.\n\nThere's a lot of historical evidence that Vitamin-D is far more important to the survival of populations than simply its ability to prevent rickets.  You're talking about something that's vital enough to population survival that it essentially drives the existence of multiple races.

If you want to argue Jesus didn\u2019t exist because the documentary evidence is flimsy, well the documentary evidence we have for most of antiquity is flimsy. We\u2019re not going to find a Jesus skeleton. It\u2019s likely that a Jesus figure did exist, but whether he was the one described in the Bible is debatable. Jesus is arguably a legendary figure, as in there was a person but his exploits are exaggerated, or they were done by someone else  but attributed to him and really our Jesus is an amalgamation of several people. The Gospels are filled with inconsistencies, misunderstood Old Testament theology and historical errors, however the idea that there was a religious zealot upset with the religious/political elites (and implicitly the Romans), preached against them and the corruption of the Jewish faith, and was slowly seeking to gain power for himself at some point, show was then executed, makes sense. \n\nIt\u2019s not an unlikely scenario, Jewish elites were very Romanized and prior to Roman conquest Hellenized, and much of the rural Jewish population hated this. It led to several revolts, such as the Maccabees revolt against the Seleucids, and then under the Romans several Roman Jewish wars (though these occurred after Jesus\u2019 time). It\u2019s likely that the Jewish revolts greatly influenced the New Testament as had been very common around the time it was being written, so tracing Jesus\u2019 lineage to David AND claiming he was \u201cKing of the Jews\u201d while also having stories about his return, would be the exact mind of messianic figure that rebellious Jews looking to expel the Romans would believe in. \n\nQuite frankly, the historicizing of Jesus I think makes him seem more realistic and comprehensible.

I did present arguments in another comment to your OP. Others responded and there was good dialogue, but you didn\u2019t engage with that comment thread. All good, I\u2019ll reproduce my comment here. But before I do I\u2019ll just encourage you to read/view actual respected scholars on the subject:\n\n[Bart Ehrman\u2019s book](https://www.amazon.com/Did-Jesus-Exist-Historical-Argument/dp/0062206443) on Jesus\u2019 historicity.\n\n[Dale Martin\u2019s undergraduate course lecture](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=d_dOhg-Fpu0) on historicity of Jesus.\n\nThe OG himself [Albert Schweitzer](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Quest_of_the_Historical_Jesus), who basically modernized historical Jesus studies.\n\nWith out further stalling: my original counter argument to your OP:\n\nThere is no hard evidence (like a body, tomb or other archaeological material), but we don\u2019t have anything like that for almost all 1st century Palestinians as well. However, the likelihood that there was a 1st century Jewish apocalyptic preacher by the name of Yeshua is pretty high. Very little we can say about him with a high degree of certainty\u2026 I would include the following: he gathered followers or disciples, he was almost certainly baptized by John, and was certainly crucified. There are historical criteria that can be used to determine the probability of certain details being true. For easy, accessible internet consumption of this type of historical scholarship, I recommend Dale Martin\u2019s Yale lectures, which you can watch for free on YouTube.\n\nAs for documentary evidence (which I consider evidence \u2014 whether good evidence or not depends on the source) - that does exist. The four canonical gospels and the apocryphal gospel of Thomas originate with oral tradition, which has its problems as a method of preservation. Still, with close analysis, scholars can glean some very cool info from them. Paul is the closest known source we have. We know Paul existed, we have some of his writings, and though he never met Jesus, he writes that he met Peter and the actual brother of Jesus, a guy named James. Now, that\u2019s not nothing. It\u2019s not a knock-down argument for Jesus\u2019 existence either, but I\u2019m putting it forward as a small piece of a larger picture.\n\nIn the end, do we have proof of Jesus existence? Of course not. But all of history is a matter of probability, and I think it\u2019s highly probable that there was a man named Jesus that was an itinerant rabbi who got on the wrong side of the law and was executed by the Roman authorities. \n\nSpeaking of the Romans, you mentioned something about crucifixion records? Do we have good reason to believe Romans kept regular records of crucifixions? I think we can understand they crucified plenty of people at that time, and especially on the outer rim of the empire where local cultures chafed against Roman rule and revolts were a real threat to the state. What records do we have of these executions? They seemed to happen regularly and summarily ordered by the ruling official. We shouldn\u2019t expect court stenography from this time. So I would be careful presuming that, because we don\u2019t have Jesus\u2019 arrest, conviction and sentencing records from Roman sources, therefore it didn\u2019t happen.", "sentiment": 0.9855}, {"id": "jc7hjtp", "author": "TerbiumInside", "parent_id": "jc7hee0", "content": "I\u2019m going to look at this in more detail later, but I\u2019ll say right now I was wrong on Roman crucifixion records and mentioned it in some other conversations.\n\nI\u2019d like to actually read these books despite what I may think of their authors (or not), so I\u2019ll have to get on it.

He insists on the suggestion made by Urban von Wahlde that the first edition of John originated with \u201can elder,\u201d possibly an immediate associate of Jesus, and therefore is early (like, earlier than Mark) and more historical than the Synoptics. I\u2019m extremely skeptical on those points. So I\u2019m reading von Wahlde now \u201cThe Gospel and Letters of John.\u201d I\u2019m convinced of the book\u2019s main thesis that the Gospel was written in stages, and the text we have now is likely a composite of three different \u201ceditors\u201d writing and editing at different times. We can drill into the literary \u201cstrata\u201d and identify which material belongs to which editor.\nHowever, I find the early dating and sourcing of a close \u201celder\u201d extremely speculative.\n\nEdit: in reply to your bit on Paul, it\u2019s not his vision that\u2019s relevant (visions happen all the time to people). What is relevant is that he met Peter, one of the twelve, and James, the brother of the historical figure in question. That to me is significant. That\u2019s as close as we get.

Here's what I found and how I think it relates (sorry, it's long):\n\nPremise:  *Jesus - crucified, according to the Bible and Christian tradition, was resurrected ~33 AD*\n\n**Events recorded in the bible**\n\nThe Darkness (Matt. 27:45)\n\n\" From noon until three in the afternoon darkness came over all the land.\"\n\nThe Temple Veil Torn (Matthew 27:51a)\n\n\"At that moment the curtain of the temple was torn in two from top to bottom. \"\n\n*Note: The veil of the Temple was a huge curtain (60 feet long, 30 feet high, and about 4 inches thick; composed of 72 squares sewn together; so heavy that it required 300 men to lift it) that formed the barrier between the Shekinah presence of God and all human beings. It being torn in two would be as momentus as the floor of St. Peter's Basilica cracking in half.*\n\nThe Earthquake & Tombs Opened (Matthew 27:51b-53)\n\n\"The earth shook, the rocks split and the tombs broke open. The bodies of many holy people who had died were raised to life. They came out of the tombs after Jesus\u2019 resurrection and went into the holy city and appeared to many people.\"\n\nAfter the resurrection, Jesus himself appeared to more than 500 people (I Cor. 15:4, 6)\n\n\"that he was buried, that he was raised on the third day according to the Scriptures,... After that, he appeared to more than five hundred of the brothers and sisters at the same time\" \n\nThese events were so noteworthy that everyone in Jerusalem knew of them (Luke 24:13-18)\n\n\"Now that same day two of them were going to a village called Emmaus, about seven miles from Jerusalem. They were talking with each other about everything that had happened. As they talked and discussed these things with each other, Jesus himself came up and walked along with them; but they were kept from recognizing him. He asked them, \u201cWhat are you discussing together as you walk along?\u201d They stood still, their faces downcast. One of them, named Cleopas, asked him, \u201cAre you the only one visiting Jerusalem who does not know the things that have happened there in these days?\u201d\n\n**Extra biblical evidence**\n\nNone of these events are recorded or mentioned in any contemporary source except the bible. \n\nNot a word about 3 hours of darkness over Jerusalem and no record of a solar eclipse in Israel anytime around this date.\n\nNot a shred of evidence from any extra biblical source that the veil was torn in half.\n\nThe various geologic surveys show no record of an earthquake in or around Jerusalem during that time period.\n\nNot even a whisper of hearsay concerning corpses coming back to life and appearing to people, much less \"many people\". \n\nNo mention in any record that Jesus appeared to anyone after the crucifixion.\n\n**Response**\n\nPaul himself, speaking on the resurrection of the dead in general, and the resurrection of Jesus in particular, says the following (I Cor. 15: 12-17, emphasis added)\n\n\"But if it is preached that Christ has been raised from the dead, how can some of you say that there is no resurrection of the dead? If there is no resurrection of the dead, then not even Christ has been raised. And if Christ has not been raised, our preaching is useless and so is your faith. More than that, we are then found to be false witnesses about God, for we have testified about God that he raised Christ from the dead. But he did not raise him if in fact the dead are not raised. For if the dead are not raised, then Christ has not been raised either. ***And if Christ has not been raised, your faith is futile***\"\n\nSo, assuming Jesus was an historical figure, and there is no evidence whatsoever of the extraordinary and fantastic events surrounding the resurrection that were evidently common knowledge in that area at that time, it can be assumed that it didn't happen.

This is not actually a crazy idea.  Socrates himself never wrote anything down, or at least if he did then there is no record of it.  All we know of Socrates comes from the writings of Plato.  It is at least *possible* that Plato invented Socrates, using him as a tool to advance philosophical ideas which might be considered dangerous and subversive, or to stage hypothetical discussions to explain his philosophy more clearly.\n\nBut, from a modern perspective, does it really matter whether Socrates existed as a real person outside Plato's imagination?  In a sense, it does NOT matter.  The ideas and concepts expressed by Socrates are what survives and they are how we define him thousands of years later.  If it was actually Plato who came up with those ideas, then Plato essentially WAS Socrates, so in that sense Socrates was real.  If many others came up with those ideas and Plato merely assembled them together and attributed them to his fictional master, then Socrates still existed in THAT sense.  We can define his existence in this loose and almost metaphorical manner because, all these thousands of years later, we do not remember Socrates as a person anyway; we remember him by the collection of ideas and philosophical concepts credited to him (and because he allegedly drank hemlock and died).  \"Socrates\" is defined by his ideas and teachings, and those definitely exist, so therefore Socrates existed.\n\nIt can be said that Jesus Christ existed in exactly the same way.  Was he a real individual who said and did everything credited to him?  Was he a preacher whose reputation far outgrew reality?  Was he an invention of his supposed followers, a \"perfect\" entity who couldn't really exist so they made him up as an ideal to aspire to?  It could be said that any of these is sufficient to say that Jesus Christ was real.\n\n***HOWEVER...***\n\nThere's one little problem with drawing that parallel.  Our modern idea of who Jesus was is NOT defined solely by what he said and believed, or even by his actions.  Above everything else, Jesus Christ is said to be the divine Son of God; without that, he is not Christ.  I submit that even if there really, definitely was a single real person upon whom the story of Jesus was entirely based, that person was NOT Jesus Christ unless he can also truthfully claim to be God Incarnate upon Earth.  To say otherwise is to completely miss the point of who Jesus Christ is.\n\nIf we were to suddenly find solid evidence for \"Historical Jesus\", it would be fascinating and an important discovery, but without the divine connection it would be of zero religious significance.  We already know that a person or people existed who were the source of the ideas and preachings of Jesus.  SOMEBODY had to come up with them, or they wouldn't have been written down in the first place.  In order to say that Jesus Christ actually existed, we need evidence of the divine, because that defines who he is.

He was executed for sedition, his corpse rotted on the cross (as was Roman custom), and his brother James 'the righteous' succeeded in his leadership role.\n\nIt's only when one gets to Paul (the creator of Christianity) that we get the effects of Paul's Geschwind syndrome: belief in the divinity of Jesus, a resurrection (but only a spiritual, not a bodily, one), and that faith in this resurrection was the main thing required for personal salvation. But there are clues in both the seven consensus epistles and in 2nd half of Acts that Paul was a troubled man, and was in doctrinal conflict with James in Jerusalem. When one adds that Paul either doesn't know or relate anything about the historical Yeshua the Nazarine's life or teachings, I find his epistles survive the 'criterion of embarrassment'. They don't describe what transpired in reality, but what transpired in Paul's mind in \\~48-60 CE.\n\nWe also have a parallel form of the Jesus movement, in the 1st century Nazarenes through the 3rd century Ebionites, attested to in the sayings gospel 'Q', the epistles of James & Jude, the Didache, the Clementine Homilies/Recognitions, and heresiologists of the 3rd and 4th century. They all attest to a sect of Judaism that regarded Jesus as wise but not divine, did not believe in the bodily resurrection, believed that only Torah observance and good works could bring salvation, practiced vegetarianism and opposed animal sacrifice, and themselves regarded Paul as a heretic. These all fit the extant descriptions of James. That, to my mind, is the form of original Jesus movement in Judaism, and its diametrically opposed to Pauline Christianity.\n\nAnd James and his relationship to Jesus is attested to in Josephus in the *Antiquities of the Jews* (93\u201394 CE). The scholarly consensus is that the Testimonium Flavianum was amended by later scribal interpolation, and we have Arabic manuscripts without that later interpolation. But I don't have any difficulty accepting that James was a successor to the martyrs John and Jesus of their Hemerobaptist/Essene sect.\n\nIs all the rest of the Christ story created 'of whole cloth' from gentiles who never met anyone who had known the historical Jesus (most were dead by 70 CE), but were informed by Paul's interpretation? IMO, yes. Mark follows the Pauline interpretation: an adoptionist Christology, and an spiritual apotheosis, rather than a bodily resurrection. Only later manuscripts added the last parts of Mark 16.

This makes scientists very uncomfortable, but that\u2019s okay because the disciplines use different methodologies. The Jesus Seminar, for example, famously color-coded the biblical sayings of Jesus: red for highly probable he said this or something like it, pink for somewhat likely he said it or something similar, gray for he probably didn\u2019t say it but it contained his ideas, and black for he probably didn\u2019t say it and it comes from later admirers or another tradition.

There are a lot of people who were wandering around during the early first century (and actually, long before that as well as for quite a while after that) who were claiming to have divine birthright, or directly being the progeny of god... In fact, you can really draw a historical line going all the way back to ancient Sumer with various kings claiming to have inherited power from their relationship to the gods. In China, the first king of the Zhang dynasty (more than 4000 years BCE) claimed his right to the throne came from being the son of god (and by virtue, the divine power of his children after him by which they inherited his title). In Egypt, the various Pharaohs all claimed they were either living gods, children of gods (typically Isis), or otherwise had godlike power by birthright. In fact, its rather striking when you start looking at Jewish and early Christian mythology how much it resembles ancient Egyptian mythology (Apis, the bull god, was the son of Osiris, who was killed and resurrected, etc)... Rome itself was supposedly founded by Romulus and Remus, who were the sons of the god Mars, and most Roman leaders were deified either during their reign or posthumously, and on that topic, Greek and Roman mythology is RIPE with stories of Gods fathering mortal children...\n\nSo, in the first century AD, Jesus was definitely not the only character claiming to be the descendant of God. The Dead Sea Scrolls themselves actually make mention of someone (NOT Jesus) called the \"Teacher of Righteousness\", who was a messianic son of god as well. Of the records that do exist from that time period, the worst part about confirming or denying the existence of many of these things is of course, the poor translations, which is compounded by the censorship and destruction of a lot of those documents... For instance, the historian and writer Celsus wrote probably the earliest debunking of Christianity, which not only attacked the validity of Christianity, addressing its shortcomings in philosophy, attributing it as a movement of the poor and lower classes, and warning about it being a threat to the Roman empire, but then of course, all copies of were ordered destroyed during the 4th century. What remains of what he wrote is only known by the criticism of it nearly a century later by the Christian historian Origen in Contra Celsum (\"Against Celsus\"). Don't get me started on Justin Martyr...\n\nThen there is the issue of the gospels themselves. The major argument I've always presented was that they were written in GREEK, not in Hebrew as one would expect from Jews, Latin as one would expect from Romans, or any of the other expected languages of the region at the time (including Aramaic, which might have been possible as the language of \\[some of\\] the Apostles or Jesus himself). Besides that oddity, none of the authors identify themselves or provide any first hand accounts of meeting the apostles, so considering the Greek penchant for storytelling rather than history (Homer with the Iliad and Odyssey, for instance), it is quite likely that those gospels were interpretations of oral stories and traditions, rather than literal interviews and accounts. When you combine that knowledge with the aforementioned concepts of how many commonalities they share with other older religions, it begins to seem less and less likely that these gospels are historical evidence for Jesus existence and more likely to have been manufactured as entertainment for poor and lower class citizens, particularly the kind who might have been ostracized by the Romans, particularly the kind who probably could not read or write themselves, and would not have been educated enough to know Hebrew or Aramaic. They were also written around the same time as Celsus probably wrote The True Word, further lending question to their credibility.\n\nThe trouble with all that history, is we will probably never know as much as we want to or need to know about it, and the more time goes on, the more of it is lost to us. So whether or not there was an actual PERSON named Jesus or not at this point really seems inconsequential. We have to grow as a species and start looking at what evidence DOES exist and what we can scientifically state with accuracy about our own history and what that teaches us about our own existence. To be quite rude about it, there is no modern evidence for conversation with god, or any number of deities. There are plenty of people who claim to hear voices, and we have scientifically determined why that happens and we either treat those people or commit them to sanitariums for the good and safety of society. We live in an age where we've actually figured out what causes things like LEPROSY (perhaps the most ubiquitous biblical disease), and we can cure it, rather easily. We live in an age where we understand the various causes of blindness and we can treat and cure some of those. We have sunglasses and sunscreen. We understand the physics of water and can build boats with a much better degree of accuracy than they could hope to achieve back then, and to that degree, we've figured out not just how to fly, but we can reach the stars. They didn't even know what stars were. It was no miracle to see Jesus walk on water, and we can not only discredit the concept of the virgin birth, but we have more or less ascertained that if Jesus really did exist, he was probably fathered by a Roman soldier named Pantera (or Ben Pandera), and once again, to be quite rude about it, if GOD wanted to show us a miracle, he shouldn't have impregnated a 14 year old unwed teenager (that shit happens all the time); If I were GOD and I wanted to impress the populous, I would have made JOSEPH pregnant.

I read most of Carrier's books as well as those of Robert Price.\n\nBut based I on my own Bible study, I could not stay a mythicist.   I am not a Bible scholar.  I can't read Greek.  But still, I have to admit that it is more likely that a physical Jesus existed than not.\n\nOverall I think the gospels and Acts are mostly books of mythology.  All of them lie about mundane facts of history, geography, and/or astronomy.  They intentionally distored facts as plot points in their story.  If the gospels and Acts cannot be trusted to tell the truth about history, how can they be trusted to tell the truth about supernatural events?\n\nMy reason for thinking there was a historical is based mostly on Paul's letters.  Paul's authentic letters are the only books in the Bible that can be attributed to the claimed author where that author was a known person.  I find Paul's letters to be credible.  He had a big ego, but he seemed to be honest.  Even when he told the story of his vision it did not seem to be embellished.  By Paul's own words it could have been a vision he had as a dream.  Paul's own letters do not claim extraordinary healings.  Paul seemed to think the resurrection happened in heaven, not on earth.\n\nPaul said that he met Peter and James the Brother of Jesus.  The problematic phrase is \"Brother of Jesus.\"  The obvious reading is that James was the biological brother of Jesus.  Carrier *et. al.* have to develop an apologetic to explain it away.  They have to say that \"Brother\" was a religious title.  But this is the only person Paul uses it for.   \n\nThe thing that caused my faith crisis as a Christian was the apologetic arguments necessary to believe the Bible.  If the Bible were true, we should not even need apologetics.  But instead Christianity needs thousands of them.  \n\nThe thing that bothers me about Jesus mythicism is that it also requires apologetics which is not very good.  The apologetic argument again the \"brother of Jesus\" seems to be particularly weak.\n\nOverall, I think Robert Price summarized the situation quite well.  He said something to the effect that if Jesus existed, he was not the Jesus portrayed in the gospels.\n\nPaul's letters make it clear that Acts is a book of mythology.  Paul's letters flat out disagree with what Acts says about Paul.  Paul's letters also show the mythological nature of the gospels.  Paul does not seem to know any of the Jesus miracle stories.  Paul does not seem to know anything about the empty tomb.  Paul does not seem to know anything about the virgin birth.  If those stories existed at the time of Paul, he probably would have heard them.  Paul traveled all over the Christian world of his time.  He corresponded widely.  Why didn't he know the stories?

If they cannot be trusted to tell the truth about mundane facts, then they cannot be trusted to tell the truth about the supernatural.\n\nIt is also significant that Paul seemed to know nothing about most of the Jesus stories, the virgin birth, or the empty tomb.  Paul traveled all over the Christian world of his time.  He corresponded with other Christians.  Paul didn't seem to hear about any of those items.  That suggests the stories were developed after Paul wrote his letters.\n\nI think we can be fairly confident about the following:\n\n* Jesus had a brother named James.\n* Jesus had devout followers.  One of them was Peter.  Mary may have been another.\n* Jesus was probably crucified by the Romans for crimes against Rome.", "sentiment": -0.9035}, {"id": "jc9e32i", "author": "FartforJoy", "parent_id": "jc42ejt", "content": "There is absolutely zero evidence for any of those things that you think we should be fairly confident about.", "sentiment": 0.4939}, {"id": "jcan1ls", "author": "dudleydidwrong", "parent_id": "jc9e32i", "content": "We should be careful about saying there is \"zero evidence.\"  There is almost always some evidence believers can point to.  It undermines our argument when we say there is zero evidence.  I think it is much more effective to say there is no objective evidence.\n\nI think it comes down to the credibility of Paul's letters.  Atheists who haven't studied the Bible tend to discount anything that appears in the Bible.  They are the flip side of Bible literalists.  Both have reduced the Bible to one-dimensional items.  Both entirely misunderstand the Bible.\n\nI am glad that I studied the Bible so much as a Christian.  It helped me see the truth and become an atheist.  I don't have to just denounce the Bible.  I can see clearly its deeply flawed human origins.\n\nThe seven undisputed letters of Paul are unique in the Bible.  They are the only books in the Bible that were written by a known person who identified themselves.  To be clear, I am talking about what Paul himself says.  I am *not* talking about the mythical Paul of Acts, and I am not talking about the version of Paul that appears in the pseudepigraphical epistles.\n\nPaul comes across as an honest guy who has a big ego.  His honesty is refreshing compared to the rest of the Bible.  His claims of the miraculous are very limited.  His miracle claims are low-key.  The most miraculous thing he claims is his vision.  It is amazingly mundane.  Basically, he says he had either a dream or a vision of Jesus; he doesn't seem to be sure which it is. I find it very credible that he could have had a dream of Jesus.  I had some of those myself as a Christian, but I have a modern understanding of dreams.  They were seen as something different in the time of Paul.  Paul doesn't get struck blind or any of the other mythological elements that are included in the story of Acts.\n\nPaul says that he met Peter and James the brother of Jesus.  It is actually pretty funny because he does not like them.  At all.  He is not impressed by them or what they teach.  His story completely undercuts the mythology in Acts.   It also knocks out the mythology of the gospels.  \n\nPaul provides at least some evidence for Peter and James.  Paul was not a witness to the crucifixion.  But he was early enough to actually know people who had first-hand knowledge.  I think it is significant that Paul doesn't ascribe supernatural events to the crucifixion as other Bible authors do.  Paul also doesn't blame the Jews.  \n\nThere is still a question of what \"brother of Jesus\" means.  Mythicists have to claim that \"brother of Jesus\" is a religious title.  To me, that feels like an apologetic argument of the type that Christians have to use.  Paul doesn't use the term for anyone else.  He doesn't use it is a religious term.  The plain reading is biological brother.  But to me the most convincing thing is that Paul doesn't like James.  I don't think he would be using a religious term that recognized him as superior to Paul himself.\n\nThere is also the mention of James the brother of Jesus in Josephus.  But that is problematic on multiple levels, so I won't go further with it.\n\nI don't think Mary Magdeline is identified in Paul's letters.  For that I am relying mostly on Ehrman.  His line of reasoning is basically that she shows up in so many early stories it is likely that she was a real person.  The stories of Mary Magdeline appear in multiple traditions such as the gnostics as well as the orthodox stories.  I think that makes her more likely than not to exist.", "sentiment": 0.9761}, {"id": "jcwr8b8", "author": "8m3gm60", "parent_id": "jc42ejt", "content": "> Even most objective scholars agree that there was a real person.\n\nAccording to the sasquatch consensus for which there is zero evidence.", "sentiment": 0.4144}, {"id": "jcy23nw", "author": "dudleydidwrong", "parent_id": "jcwr8b8", "content": "It is not zero evidence.

He was explicit in the factors and weights he applied to his analysis.  His calculations came out with about a 30% chance of Jesus existing.

I agree with something that Robert Price said.

Ehrman criticizes Carrier because he is not a tenured faculty member at a major academic institution.  I don't think that is really valid.

The strange gyrations the story makes to try and explain how this is are not only demonstrably inaccurate, they make no sense in a purely fictional sense; that is, if purely fiction, why not just have Jesus Of Bethlehem?\n\nBecause when Matthew invented his birth narrative, he had to contort the story to fit multiple apparently-contradictory prophecies.\n\nMatthew 2:23 says:\n\n> He went and lived in a town called Nazareth. So was fulfilled what was said through the prophets, that he would be called a Nazarene.\n\nNo such prediction exists in our current Old Testament, so we don't know what source Matthew is quoting.  Maybe he was drawing on a now-unknown source, maybe he was being metaphorical (e.g. Isaiah 11:1 says \"A shoot will come up from the stump of Jesse; from his roots a Branch will bear fruit\" and the Hebrew root of \"Nazareth\" is the same as that for _netser_, meaning \"branch\"), but the point is that whoever wrote Matthew clearly felt that Jesus being associated with Nazareth fulfilled an important prophecy.\n\nBut!  Matthew 2:4-6 says:\n\n> When he had called together all the people\u2019s chief priests and teachers of the law, he asked them where the Messiah was to be born.  \u201cIn Bethlehem in Judea,\u201d they replied, \u201cfor this is what the prophet has written:\n\n> \u201c\u2018But you, Bethlehem, in the land of Judah,  \n> are by no means least among the rulers of Judah;  \n> for out of you will come a ruler  \n> who will shepherd my people Israel.\u2019\u201d\n\nSo a prophecy says the messiah will be from Nazareth and a prophecy says the messiah will be from Bethlehem and Matthew's messiah has to somehow fulfill both.  How to do that?\n\nEasy: invent a narrative that has Jesus born in Bethlehem and raised in Nazareth so he can \"come forth\" from Bethlehem but be called \"a Nazarene.\"\n\nNotice that Luke also posits that Jesus was born in Bethlehem and ends up in Nazareth, but invents a _different_ reason to place Jesus's birth in Bethlehem (one that we know is false because the dates are wrong for Quirinius's governorship and Roman censuses Did Not Work That Way).\n\nNotice also that Matthew adds a detour to Egypt that isn't present in Luke, so that he can shoehorn in another prophecy about God calling \"his son\" (originally Israel) out of Egypt.\n\nAnd of course both birth narratives were invented by their authors, because no birth narrative is present in Mark, the gospel that Matthew and Luke almost entirely copy.\n\nWhile you could take the contradiction as being evidence of the gospels tacking a fictional Bethlehem birth onto the story of a historical figure from Nazareth, I'd say it's much stronger evidence for the idea that _both_ the Bethlehem connection _and_ the Nazareth claim were fictional because both authors were clearly more concerned with \"fulfilling the scriptures\" than reporting history.\n\n---\n\nThis isn't the first time the gospels (primarily Matthew) would have done this, taking scripture literally and tweaking his story to make it seem like Jesus fit whatever prophecy he was looking at.  For instance, Zechariah 9:9 says:\n\n> Behold, your king is coming to you, humble, and **mounted on a donkey, and on a colt**, the foal of a donkey.\n\nThe parallelism in Zechariah is a poetic device; see e.g. [here](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/palm-sunday-confusion-did_b_516321) for an explanation.  The gospel of Mark knows it's a poetic device and has Jesus ride into Jerusalem on a colt in Mark 11:7:\n\n> When they brought the colt to Jesus and threw their cloaks over it, he sat on it\n\nBut that's not enough for Matthew, who takes the \"prophecy\" literally, so he changes that to make Jesus literally ride both a donkey _and_ a colt at the same time:\n\n> And brought the ass, and the colt, and put on them their clothes, and they set him thereon.\n\nAgain, the gospel author shows that he's not concerned about reporting historical fact, but rather providing \"evidence\" that his Jesus fits the prophecies around a messiah.\n\n---\n\n>  There is also Jesus following and being baptized by John The Baptist. The fact that the son of God would need to be baptized, and would be following another religious leader seems another odd point to include in something that would be purely fictional.\n\nIt makes perfect sense if you want to deliberately construct a story to show that your own guy is more awesome than the other guy.\n\nThere's no historical evidence at all that John the Baptist was doing his thing as \"preparation\" for anyone else, but Mark 1 claims that that's what he was doing, putting the words in his mouth that \"After me comes the one more powerful than I, the straps of whose sandals I am not worthy to stoop down and untie\" when he baptizes Jesus, and Matthew 3 has him claim that _Jesus_ was supposed to baptize _him_.\n\nComing up with that story is much like the early Catholic Church co-opting pagan holidays for Christian ones, or the Roman religion claiming that the gods of conquered peoples were _really_ the Roman gods under other names, or Islam claiming that Jesus was totally a real prophet but not as cool of a prophet as Mohammed, or any number of other examples of religious syncretism throughout history: it takes the existing religious belief of some other group and shows how their belief is better by absorbing and changing the other belief to serve their own.\n\nThere's also the fact that anyone hearing about Jesus in the early days might know that John the Baptist existed and want to know how he tied into the whole thing, so the gospels would want to come up with _some_ story to explain things.\n\nIt's like how any claim that Jesus was crucified by the Romans would need to come up with a story about who did it and why, so the gospels feature Pontius Pilate, but their depiction of him is completely at odds with the historical Pilate: the gospels' Pilate is a chill guy who basically says \"Well, the crowds want to kill him, guess I should let them do it, sorry Jesus\" whereas the actual historical Pilate was known for being too _harsh_ on agitators and more than willing to send in soldiers to break up a riot.  The story incorporates a real contemporary figure, but in a way that fits with the story the gospel is trying to tell rather than their actual historical personality.\n\n---\n\n> Of course, that obviously doesn't support anything divine or mythical (actually is a bit contradictory on that point), but it is a small amount of evidence of a real person being somewhere behind some of the stories.\n\nIt could be, certainly, but it's also evidence for the idea that the \"Jesus\" figure was constructed out of a variety of scriptural sources to support a variety of goals, and so the resulting stories have contradictions because the source narratives had contradictions and any historical figures found in them are out of character because they're building a narrative, not reporting historical fact.", "sentiment": 0.8751}, {"id": "jc4h9cm", "author": "crikett23", "parent_id": "jc486xh", "content": "Yes, I get the poetic device use.  The main thing we are looking at different is the Nazareth element.  I do not look at this as being a specific prophecy, but more likely one of three things - or, as I  conjectured in my original post, more of a combination of those things.  Either a slight mistranslation of branch, or implication that coming from Nazareth was more literal in meaning as a branch of the divine; second, the overall unfavorable view of the area that would be popular around the time of the Gospel's writing, relating back to prophecy around lowly birth; and lastly, as I already mentioned (and not in contradiction to the previous options), the basis of an actual religious teacher from that time and locale.\n\nThe evidence for John the Baptist is certainly great than for Jesus (as far as there is some), and based on early church writings, it seems there was quite a bit of crossover related to his teachings compared with teachings that would later be attributed to Jesus.  Combined with what I said earlier...\n\nThough I am not sure it is that similar to the co-opting of other religious traditions (or iconography, which I've always thought has more potential connections to the crucifixion  than any historical happening).  That is because the early church was a religion for Jewish people, and, if there was a historical Jesus, this would've been what he was teaching - a non-orthodox version of Judaism.  Most of the co-opted elements seem to have arrived with what I can only think of as some form of marketing, as Christianity moved to become a religion of the masses.\n\nOf course, problematic in all of this is most sources we have now are those that were considered \"official\" well after the events in question.

Not in court records, not in Asian texts, only the Bible and some hearsay mentions by Josephus, Tacitus and Piny the Younger writing around 95-115 AD and even some of these are thought to be later forgeries.\n\nAll the historians of the time living in and around Jerusalem or with connections to it such as Herod the Great's court historian Nicolaus of Damascus, Justus of Tiberias the secretary of Herod Agrippa II who ruled when Jesus' disciples and followers were supposedly still stirring up trouble in Judea, or Philo of Alexander who knew Pontius Pilate seem to have heard of Jesus or his disciples.", "sentiment": -0.5994}, {"id": "jva7w24", "author": "TheBrahmnicBoy", "parent_id": "jv9vfco", "content": "What's interesting is that there are archeological records of other kings (Assyrian and Babylonian, I think) in the old testament.\n\nEven if Yeshua was a real person, unless you're really important, there's not going to be a lot of evidence for you. \n\nWhat do you think of Matt Bakers videos (Useful charts) on these topics?", "sentiment": 0.5849}, {"id": "jvad74v", "author": "dostiers", "parent_id": "jva7w24", "content": "> Even if Yeshua was a real person, unless you're really important, there's not going to be a lot of evidence for you.\n\nBut there is more evidence for other agitators and messiah claimants of the day.  For example, compare what Josephus wrote about [Athronges](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athronges) and [Judas the Galilean](https://www.livius.org/articles/religion/messiah/messianic-claimant-4-judas-the-galilean/) with the [couple of sentences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josephus_on_Jesus) about Jesus, and even the authenticity of these are disputed.\n\nIt is the same for evidence of rival Jewish sects establishing around the time Jesus supposedly lived. For example this [longish tract](http://catholicgnosis.wordpress.com/2009/01/01/the-essenes-philo-quod-omnis-probus-liber-sit/) about the Essenes by Philo of Alexandria. Philo wrote not a single word about Jesus, his disciples, or Christianity which was then just another sect of Judaism.\n\nIf anything, Philo should have been even more aware of Christians than the Essenes if what the Bible claims about early Christianity were true for he was a grandson of Herod the Great so had access to the highest levels of the Jewish imperial court in Jerusalem.  One of his nephews, [Tiberius Julius Alexander](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiberius_Julius_Alexander), was the Roman procurator (governor, i.e. same job as Pontius Pilate, but at a higher rank) of Judea in 46-48, only some 13-18 years after Jesus' supposed death. Philo and Tiberius seem to have been in regular communication as some of Tiberius' letters appear in Philo's works. To thicken the plot further, another nephew, [Marcus Julius Alexander](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcus_Julius_Alexander), was the husband of Bernice, a daughter of Herod Agrippa, another grandson of King Herod, and then the ruler of Judea. So Philo certainly had the connections that should have made him aware of Jesus and the events around his death. \n\nHerod Agrippa supposedly personally killed John's brother James, and persecuted the Church (Acts 12:1-2), and St Peter was supposedly rescued by angels while chained and guarded by four squads of troops in Agrippa's prison (Acts 12.3-7). You'd think at least the latter would have been talked about within the family, albeit without the supernatural aspects. Seems not.\n\nPhilo also personally knew Pontius Pilate and wrote a whole book about him. It no longer exists only being known from references by other ancient authors, for example by Eusebius as [discussed here](http://www.earlyjewishwritings.com/text/philo/book36.html). However, it is likely that it didn't mention Jesus because such a reference would have been seized on by the early Christian apologists looking for evidence to support the historicity of Jesus. Indeed, the absence may be why the book was lost when much of Philo's other works survived.\n\nWe do still have a reference to Pilate in another of his books, [Embassy to Gaius p299-305](http://www.earlychristianwritings.com/yonge/book40.html). This was the only remaining contemporary evidence we had for Pilate until the discovery of the Pilate Stone in 1961.

Your eye is the lamp of your body. When your eye is healthy, your whole body is full of light, but when it is bad, your body is full of darkness. Therefore be careful lest the light in you be darkness. If then your whole body is full of light, having no part dark, it will be wholly bright, as when a lamp with its rays gives you light.\u201d\r\nLuke 11:33\u202d-\u202c36 ESV*\n\nSave you from what?", "sentiment": 0.7133}, {"id": "jstrphq", "author": "NinaCulotta", "parent_id": "jss99q0", "content": "Condemnation from sin, due to, y'know, existing as a human.

Interpreted according to the modern intromission theory of vision, it would imply that the eye is seen as a window through which light enters into the body. Such an interpretation is anachronistic. The saying makes sense in a picturesque way when interpreted in terms of the ancient extramission theory of vision. The proverbial notion that the eye is the lamp of the body suggests that the eye emits rays when looking. According to the custom to find a direct correlation between body and character in ancient understanding the state of an eye signifies the internal character of a being. Therefore the description of the physical eye should be interpreted in ethical terms. Sight is a function of moral light within a person. The eye is the channel from which innermost moral attitudes of the heart flows. In the eyes the character and moral quality of a person are reflected.\n\nThe gist of this saying is: If the eye is healthy, it functions as the light of the body and indicates that the owner is sincere, generous and helpful. The owner has moral integrity and seeks the welfare of others. But when the eye turns bad and evil, it indicates that the owner is stingy and envious, even to the point of wishing that the wealth of others be destroyed. Therefore the text is not merely concerned with the nature of the person, but with his or her actions that are caused by such nature \u2013 either selfish greed or obedience, Godly trust and generosity with regard to one's treasures (Mt 6:19\u201321), loyalties (Mt 6:24) and means of survival (Mt 6:25\u201334).\n\nThis logion is uttered to provoke concern about inner light. The conscientious hearer should consider: What if my inner light is darkened? How can it be enlightened again? I have to uphold the virtue of generosity in a culture of rife competition for rare resources.\n\n[Source](http://www.scielo.org.za/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&pid=S0259-94222009000100023)\n\nTL;DR: the world doesn't shape the way you see the world. you choose how you see the world.

In my experience just knowing peers, people hit puberty and the vast majority of guys instinctively have a very very strong attraction to women and a vast majority of women have an instinctive strong attraction to men. Growing up gay in a very conservative environment I literally didn't know any other LGBT peers, to come out back then was to be judged because no one could understand a \"same-sex attraction struggle\" or \"gender dysphoria.\" They all fit the typical \"I have no dysphoria regarding my gender\" and \"I'm only attracted to the opposite sex.\" I knew this was evident in rhetoric that was common with conversion/reparative therapy still being the dominant recommendation for an LGBT person within the Christian faith and the idea that \"no on is born LGBT\" and that to experience same-sex attraction or gender dysphoria is the result of some personally chosen spiritual or mental depravity where the individual is actively rejecting some kind of innate cishetero orientation and actively choosing to go against what is \"natural\" for whatever reason. Common rhetoric back then said people chose to be gay due to broken families (overbearing mom or dad), due to sexual trauma \"confusing\" them in teen/adult years, the lack of an ability to attract and opposite-sex person so the \"settle for the same sex\" or that their sexuality is warped somehow by porn or demons or something else. \n\nI've shared numerous times that my experience was I hit puberty and BOOM, I was only attracted to men and I was mentally torturing myself regarding how I could not find a woman attractive like my other male peers in my age group. I heard all the rhetoric about sexuality being \"a choice\" and that homosexual orientations were due to mental or spiritual illness that can be cured via submission to Christ. After I came out as a gay person so many of my old friends were like \"I literally can't understand how you like guys, that's just so disgusting\" with others blaming it on demons I've allowed into my life and other such nonsense. They didn't have the mental or emotional capacity to empathize that my sexuality is just like theirs, it is instinctive and not chosen by me and just like how my male peers went crazy for women, I did so for men. When I explained to someone what a crush feels like to me with having warm butterflies in my stomach, a desire for closeness with the person I'm attracted to, my desire to form a loving and intimate bond with them, etc. many were shocked since they viewed \"gay temptation\" as nothing more than some depraved act of sex where it's all some kind if weird or kinky lust with no love component. One hetero guy said \"wow... the way you experience a crush sounds just like how I do for girls!\" He was shocked to learn that contrary to right wing Christian propaganda, homosexuals do experience love analogous to heterosexuals and it's not all rooted in some base carnal sexual perversion. \n\nMany Christians view opposing LGBT rights as engaging in a holy crusade against sin via the \"culture wars.\" I can't tell you how many times people quoted the story of Sodom and Gomorrah with \"homosexual sin\" being the driving factor for why God judged those cities. Pastors like Jerry Falwell, Pat Robertson, etc. all pushed extreme falsehoods against LGBT people going so far as to blame terrorism, natural disasters, HIV, etc. on \"gay sin\" and used that as evidence that God was judging America for permitting such \"perversion.\" It was all politics because back then many states wanted to \"protect the sanctity of marriage\" by enshrining constitutional clauses into their state constitution formally banning same-sex marriage by defining marriage as \"one man one woman\" and this was supposed \"family values.\" It was so warped, because their \"family values and protecting the sanctity of holy marriage\" meant denying people like me the right to marry or have a family with a partner I share physical and romantic attraction to just like they were doing. It was all scare tactics stating \"the first step is homosexuality, the next steps will be bestiality and pedophilia!\" I think many Christians engage in politically charged culture wars under the guise of Biblical ethics when really they are being manipulated for political gain. \n\nI think things are further evident when Christians reduce \"same-sex attraction\" to some predisposed struggle when comparing it to alcoholism, violence, or adultery. It's commonly argued that \"some people are predisposed to alcoholism, to murder, to violence, and to cheating on their spouse and lust\" and further argue \"just because you are predisposed to homosexuality doesn't make it right.\" The fundamental flaw in this is they still view homosexual orientation as nothing but lust, and that it is not comparable to when two heterosexuals fall in love and make like long marriage vows to one another. They can't empathize with LGBT people, and they can't view a same-sex marriage as analogous to their hetero marriage and as such completely ignore the emotional hell they are thrusting upon others by effectively telling them \"all of your attractions are inherently sinful, you cannot experience romantic love like I am allowed to. Your relational desires are due to a fallen sinful world, mine are fallen and sinful to although my desire for love and sex within marriage is holy whereas yours is always evil and vile.\" For a gay Christian this can place them in a state of spiritual, emotional, and mental torment where they have to gaslight themselves that they are not worthy of marital love, that they are inherently broken, and that the worst thing for their soul is to fall in love with a same-sex partner which is instinctive to their nature and experience the identical emotions that their hetero peers take for granted. Imagine every time the Bible talks about covenant marital unions and makes an allegory to how God loves us, and then quickly having to stop thinking about it because it's now \"sinful temptation\" when you think about how you can love a same-sex partner with marital affection but can't dwell on that thought because now you are sinning. Imagine every time a pastor uses their hetero marriage in a sermon illustration and thinking \"yeah I understand the illustration, but I also can't because for me the same thing is evil, vile, and will land me in hell.\" You're forever outcast to the fringes of the faith, judged by individuals who can't extend the emotional capacity to empathize with you, and from their place of privilege they refuse to acknowledge that your same-sex romantic and physical attractions are not analogous to their hetero ones. \n\nVariations in human sexuality is due to biology, not mental or spiritual illness. It is an instinct and for homosexual people our brains possess the instinct as if we were the opposite sex (thus leading to wanting the same sex). We can't change it, it's a *physical* trait of who we are via how God formed our brains and is more analogous to skin color, hair color, eye color, height, or any other physical characteristic others would say is wrong to judge people on. I'd challenge anti-LGBT Christians to try and fully understand what they are saying to LGBT Christians when they say \"you have to be single, you have no holy outlet for marital love or sex\" and then see if they would say the same thing to their hetero friends or even if that is a potential \"truth\" they could accept for themselves. I'd also challenge them to read scientific papers showing that homosexuality is brain biology, not spiritual or mental illness. God makes people gay.\n\n[https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.0801566105](https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.0801566105) \r  \n\r  \n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-84496-z#Sec22](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-84496-z#Sec22) \r  \n\r  \n[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8604863/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8604863/) \r  \n\r  \n[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3138231/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3138231/) \r  \n\r  \n[https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn14146-gay-brains-structured-like-those-of-the-opposite-sex/](https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn14146-gay-brains-structured-like-those-of-the-opposite-sex/)", "sentiment": 0.9809}, {"id": "jsruafu", "author": "tomfow", "parent_id": "jsqv77y", "content": "https://www.reddit.com/r/GayChristians/comments/qfhpd9/just_carry_your_cross/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=ioscss&utm_content=2&utm_term=1", "sentiment": 0.0}, {"id": "jsr43lp", "author": "PandaCommando69", "parent_id": "jsqv77y", "content": "Good post.", "sentiment": 0.4404}, {"id": "jstv0mb", "author": "ItsMichaelRay", "parent_id": "jsqv77y", "content": "Happy Cake Day!", "sentiment": 0.6114}, {"id": "jsw85k2", "author": "Dr_Digsbe", "parent_id": "jstv0mb", "content": "Thank you!", "sentiment": 0.4199}, {"id": "jsry6cb", "author": "Abdial", "parent_id": "jsqv77y", "content": "Alternatively, there is nothing inherently correct with the way a person is born.

Fifteen hundred years of Christian churches saying \"arsenokoitai is 'homosexual'\" doesn't change the fact that *the original context in which the word was used, and the context in which it was written into the bible*, does not support that later innovation. \n\nBut yeah, you're free to extrapolate Catholic theologians from the dark ages and assume that they had a more perfect knowledge of Koine Greek than Koine Greek speakers in Antiquity, but personally I'd see it as more theologically sound to just ignore them as trying to shove a specific worldview onto their holy text which got passed down for generations uncritically until we realized that being gay isn't a mental disorder and maybe it's worth double checking the whole condemnation thing to see if that *actually* exists in the Bible.\n\nlate edit, but to answer your second part:\n\n\u05d6\u05b8\u05db\u05b8\u05e8 (Z-K-R) is used for \"male\" here but can also mean \"child\", and the same word is used as \"child\" in Genesis 17:12, Genesis 17:14, Exodus 13:15, and Leviticus 12:7. So no, even the old testament's \"men who lie with men\" is not as cut and dry. You're used to reading *editorial decisions explicitly intended to condemn homosexuality*, which is not the same thing as what exists in the original text, not as a result of modern scholarly reinterpretation, but through sincere attempts to understand the context in which the text was written.

I'd urge you to remain assuming good faith, because it's pretty clear you're tempted to treat me as exclusively engaging in bad faith. I don't *want* the Bible to say anything; I'm not Christian and what the Bible does or does not say has absolutely no impact on my life, as it doesn't guide it in any way. I don't judge those for whom it does.\n\nAlso, three points to counter your assumption of bad faith:\n\n1. Unlike some of the more, shall we say *gung ho* people on this term, I am perfectly willing to acknowledge that historical context almost certainly is referring to some form of male-on-male sexual activity. That's not the same thing as \"homosexuality\" and in context likely isn't the same thing.Again, Classical Greeks historically didn't shy away from this topic.\n\n2. I can acknowledge that even if the Bible is generally mistranslated, that doesn't magically change the theology of various denominations, though I personally believe it should trigger the modern equivalent of an ecumenical council. It is entirely possible for KJV-onlyists to simply not care what the \"correct\" Greek is, as to them the English is \"correct\". As such, I don't believe this translation issue is a \"gotcha.\"\n\n2. I care about what it *actually says*. Since I'm not a Christian, nor am I an atheist out to disprove Christianity or something like that, I have absolutely *zero* horse this race other than continued confusion around how much people are willing to overlook historical editorializing that conforms to their prejudices.\n\nIf you're a Christian, shouldn't you care about the word of god, rather than what someone ~1500 years ago told you what the word of god was? If someone tells you it's a mistranslation, shouldn't it be very easy to disprove without relying on sources that derive their moral authority from a given translation? \n\nI can definitely think of a recent instance, it may be referenced in the article I linked though I can't remember off the top of my head, where editors working on a translation attempted to remove \"homosexuality\" from Romans as inaccurate (which it emphatically is) and got so much pushback they left it in because of people worried that it was editorializing, when in reality it was exactly the opposite?", "sentiment": 0.972}, {"id": "jsv1nes", "author": "Greg-Pru-Hart-55", "parent_id": "jst56pn", "content": "Except that scholars and translators \\*literally didn't\\* translate that word as homosexuality until the last 400 years.", "sentiment": 0.0}, {"id": "jsv1rit", "author": "Greg-Pru-Hart-55", "parent_id": "jss123r", "content": "No they don't.

More vetting and training goes into joining the military or even getting an entry level job at a bank than in gaining a position within a church that puts you in a leadership role with authority over others. The bank is more careful before it lets you handle others money than the church is putting people in positions where others look to them to help them walk the straight and narrow.

You decide for yourself. That's literally one of the core values of the community.\n \nEdit: my bad. You did provide some details.

I guess the term semibisexual has been used as kind of a troll sexuality to try to make it seem like being straight is part of the lgbt community. I am not really sure because I have not really heard people identifying themselves with this, this is just what I found looking it up. 2. Maybe they looked at your post history and saw that you ranted about why you can\u2019t call people \u201ctrannies.\u201d 3. The post you sent to asklgbt gave very little details about your sexuality so with just the post alone no one can offer any thoughts, so maybe they just deleted it instead of giving you a chance to explain in the comments.

God did not make us messed up, the original creation messed up in the beginning and God created a way for them to not remain messed up. \n\nIn the Bible Adam and Eve were made perfectly, and given free will. This creation was designed for closeness to the perfection of the creator. They made a choice to do something that changed them forever, their DNA was permanently altered. This also made them incapable of the same closeness to the perfection of the creator or they would be destroyed. Like an impurity in gold in a furnace. To save the creation they were given distance, separation. However, every offspring from the original creation would have the same DNA so this condition is passed on from generation to generation as DNA has memory. This is why we say what was done affects us all or we are all in a fallen state.\n\nAs mankind began to thrive and grew in numbers, they only became increasingly wicked and continued to alter their DNA creating an even greater separation. So they were all destroyed in a flood, except one family to start over. Though there were remnants of this altered DNA that survived, the creation is given a second chance at thriving. \n\nThe purging of entire bloodlines in the Bible was to rid the remnants of this altered DNA so that the permanent fix could be delivered. The purging took generations until there was a vessel that could be used to deliver the solution\u2026which is the way to restore creation back to its intended existence of closeness with the creator. Gods likeness/spirit is placed in the womb of a woman from a preserved bloodline. This is why we say Jesus is our savior and our salvation. \n\nThough we are born predisposed, through Jesus Christ we have the ability for restoration. \n\nSo this is why we say \u201cbe born again in Christ\u201d and that we are saved by Christ. Or that we are born predisposed to all kinds of infirmities genetically via our parents DNA. Same way some illnesses are hereditary or how we are predisposed to whatever our parents or grandparents were afflicted by. \n\nThe comment, \u201cI was born this way\u201d is understood by most Christians. What isn\u2019t understood is \u201cI am wanting to remain the way I was born\u201d\u2026to us, no matter what the situation, sounds like choosing separation from the creator which is the worse condition possible. I personally wouldn\u2019t want anyone to journey through life in separation from God.

But you cannot refine something unless what you are looking for is already in there.\n\nThe Christian gospel speaks of a goodness that has been seized by something external, which needs to be liberated. It does not speak of a goodness which has gone missing altogether and must be replaced.\n\nEven the command to repent itself implies this. If we had no ability in ourselves to repent whatsoever, if our wills had been so corrupted that we could not even want to return to God, what good would a command do? Christ's message to repent preaches of humans who \u2013 still bearing God's image in a profound way that often radiates outward \u2013 want to reply, \"I will, with God's help.\"\n\n>\u201cWe are all broken in such a way that we have an infinite amount of work to do on ourselves.\u201d\n\nThat still rings as so daggum *Protestant* to me.

Of course not. But is he saying that they are infinitely corrupted and that everything about them is broken? Quite the opposite.\n\nThere is plenty in the human condition that is in fact praiseworthy. Humans do noble things every day.

Sure, one day I might find a wife, but that's still 35+ years of struggle that you're essentially saying is \"wrong\" and that I should have given into my desires and sinned because \"I'm human.\" I can tell you that after years of struggle, God finally freed me from the sin of pornography. I'm pretty sure I wasn't even saved until he healed me around 7 months ago. I was an emotionless robot for years who felt nothing. I couldn't love, I didn't care about anyone, and I didn't even care about myself, and I would be lucky to go a week without looking at pornography even though I hated it. Now? In an instant I was healed, and now pornography is gone, and I can love people and have compassion for people. God truly healed me and gave me a new heart.

What we are actually promised is that we need to rely on the power of God or we will fail. If God doesn't heal us and change us, we will never live the way he wants us to. So you can choose: do you trust that God can really change you and give you a new heart that is able to follow him? And do you trust him without giving up even if it takes years (like it did with me)? Or do you create your own god and worship an idol because you refuse to believe the words of the God of the bible?  \n  \nIn my years and years struggling with singleness and pornography, I always acknowledged pornography was a sin. I never gave up and made my own god with easier rules to follow. I did give up on believing that God would really heal me from it (even though I still prayed and asked every time I gave in). But I always believed in the God of the bible who refused to heal me. And then, eventually, he **_did_** heal me, in his own perfect timing. And now I can be single without giving into my \"human\" desires. I might one day find a wife. But I'm not actively looking. I care more about praying for the lost people in my life because I want God to save them. Because I actually love them now.

(I can recommend ESV and NKJV, there are more but those are what I know can be used. Technically the KJV exists as well but for the sake of not dealing with old English use the NKJV so you can understand if you pick that)\n\nMatthew 24:23-25 this ties into the false teachers part as well\n\nMatthew 5:10-12 Matthew 5:43-45 1 Peter 3:13-17 Be warned now, the road of Christianity is NOT always pleasant and it will NOT make your days be filled with people liking you NOR make them nothing but good things. It can and will have challenges, biblical Christianity is one of the most persecuted religions and many turn away because they did not know what they were getting into. It does not help that a lot expected perfect lives because of false teachers and their lies. (Yes these false teachers would be wolves in sheep's clothing)\n\nMany names (different denominations) will take upon the name of Jesus Christ our Savior and Lord, but never forget the truth is in God's word and you should read it for yourself, don't just take what someone tells you and assume it to be true either without double checking it and finding the context of scriptures that are thrown about.\n\nFinally I want to put this here as well\n\nhttps://youtube.com/shorts/46VhLGkTd8A?feature=share", "sentiment": 0.9753}, {"id": "ju6equb", "author": "Emmatical", "parent_id": "ju67jqh", "content": "Thankyou for your detailed advice!

They were Joseph's children from a previous wife, making them half-brothers.", "sentiment": 0.0772}, {"id": "jtujhkr", "author": "NathanStorm", "parent_id": "jttqka4", "content": ">They were extended family members of Jesus through either Joseph's brethren or Mary's brethren, making them Jesus' first cousins rather than literal blood brothers.\n\nBut the text doesn't indicate they were cousins. Also, this is very inconsistent with the portrayal of Mary and the brothers coming together as a family to dissuade Jesus from his mission:\n\n**Mark 3:31\u201332**: *There came then his brethren and his mother, and, standing without, sent unto him, calling him. And the multitude sat about him, and they said unto him, Behold, thy mother and thy brethren without seek for thee.*\n\n>They were Joseph's children from a previous wife, making them half-brothers.\n\nNo. This is also inconsistent with Mark 3:31\u201332, as the brothers would already need to be in their forties and older, with their own families and their own responsibilities. Another problem with James, Joses, Juda and Simon being older brothers is that neither nativity account mentions them travelling with Joseph and Mary. Would Joseph and Mary really have gone to Egypt, leaving the other children behind in Bethlehem and at the mercy of Herod (Matthew 2:14: \u201cWhen he arose, he took the young child and his mother by night, and departed into Egypt:\u201d)? Or would Joseph and Mary really have travelled all the way from Nazareth to Bethlehem, leaving the other children behind?  \nIf Jesus had siblings, as stated in the gospels, they had to be younger brothers and sisters and therefore the children of Mary. When Paul talks of \u201cJames, the Lord\u2019s brother\u201d in Galatians 1:19\u20132:12, it is almost universally assumed that \u201cthe Lord\u201d is Jesus and that James is his brother. James appears to be a man in the prime of his life and able to command those around him, at least somewhat unlikely to have been the eldest of five brothers, the youngest of whom was presumably born at least fifty years earlier.", "sentiment": -0.5362}, {"id": "jtwufdg", "author": "TheRedLionPassant", "parent_id": "jtujhkr", "content": "It doesn't indicate it, no, but the Greek *adelphoi* can mean that.\n\n> According to context, the Greek plural noun \u1f00\u03b4\u03b5\u03bb\u03c6\u03bf\u03af (adelphoi), from a- ('same') and delphys ('womb'), may mean physical brothers, physical brothers and sisters, figurative brothers, or figurative brothers and sisters. Adelphoi sometimes means more than a blood brother, e.g. Gen 29:12; Rom 9:3 (kinsman); Matt 5:22-23 (neighbor); Mark 6:17-18 (step-brother). In such instances the context must determine the meaning. Adelphoi is distinct from anepsios, meaning cousin, nephew, niece, and this word is never used to describe James and the other siblings of Jesus. Although neither Hebrew nor Aramaic had a word for \"cousin\", both customarily spoke of a cousin as a \"son of an uncle\" (Heb. ben dod; Aram. bar dad) and the Septuagint, the Greek translation of the Old Testament, never translates either expression as \"brother\" or \"sister\".\n\nAlso, John Calvin's Commentary on the Gospel of John:\n\n> Under the word \"brethren\" the Hebrews include all cousins and other relations, whatever may be the degree of affinity.\n\nIn regards to St. James the Just, it's complicated as there are a number of people called James in the New Testament.  But Calvin also interpreted him as being the son of Mary's sister and her husband Alphaeus:\n\n> This is fully consistent with the opinion commonly held, that Alpheus or Cleopas was the husband of the sister of Mary, the mother of our Lord, and consequently that James, the son of Alpheus, was our Lord\u2019s cousin.\n\nIt may be that they were biological blood brothers, but equally, it may not.

Also rereading my comment I may have come off more harsh than I meant so sorry about that, it sounds accusatory. Anyway to answer this we have to establish what exactly we mean by \"tradition.\" I'll sidestep how catholics specifically approach this, since they have complicating issues like papal Infallibility which are foreign to (and rejected by) Orthodoxy.\n\nPeople raised in protestant contexts usually see this idea of \"tradition\" as a reifying concept. That there are protestants, who have scripture alone, and other Christians, who have scripture + some other stuff they added on after they call tradition. But to the Orthodox, holy scripture is as much (and in fact, is the crown jewel of) tradition, not a separate part of the faith. To say they believe in tradition over scripture is really a contradiction in terms\n\nThe reason for this perspective is actually quite simple. Tradition isn't just a set of things that exists in the past that we refer to (these are the outward forms), it is the very life of the holy spirit within the church. Active, not history, from Pentecost to today. Tradition, such understood, actually precedes and grounds every other product of the church the same way a tree with it's roots precedes and nourishes its fruit. These fruits accumulate around the church, never changing in essence but articulating and renewing her message generation by generation. They include her saints and martyrs, practices, sacraments, theologians, councils, creeds, hymns, liturgy, iconography, even architecture. All external works and forms of the church. And finally, this includes scripture itself, which may even scandalize some to say. Yet obviously the church existed for decades before she produced the Bible as we have it now.\n\nHow scripture derives it's authority is beyond the scope here, but of course all parts of tradition aren't equal in authority. Like I said before, scripture is the crown jewel of holy tradition. Following this, the creed and the councils (seen as the binding action of the holy spirit). These two pillars of tradition are inviolable, you could say infallible. The moment you violate scripture or the councils, you have by definition left Orthodoxy. And if either were proven fallible, the church would be false. These are essentially the dogma of the church. Beyond that though, things are much more flexible than people think. The writings of the fathers for example, while rightly treasured for their understanding, are not on the same level of dogma. In fact, in many areas they openly contradict each other. It's basically categorized this way: on one side, you have dogma. The unified pronouncements of the church in the holy spirit. On the other side, you have heresy. That which contradicts dogma. In between all this though you have something referred to as theologoumena (what is said about God). Essentially, what is thought by the church but under discussion by the church. But an opinion about the divine, if it contradicts scripture, is obviously not valid. Even if given by a saint\n\nI would love to keep going but I know this is already too long.

If he was to die, naturally that responsibility falls to the next eldest. But if she only had one son, it became his responsibility to name a male protector for her if he could die.

But then as Matthew 1:25 says;\n\n>\u201dHe did not have marital relations with her **until she had given birth to a son**; and he named him Jesus.\u201d  ISV \n\nThen Luke 2:41-50 describes the time when Joseph and Mary were getting ready to leave Jerusalem after the festival and Jesus was about 12 years old. Now think about this for a minute\u2026 if Jesus had been their only child, do you think that it could be reasonably possible that they would leave him behind? \n\nBut now reason on the scriptures. Let the scriptures teach you. Keep those glasses off. Don\u2019t put anything into them that\u2019s just not there. With Jesus being 12, how many younger half brothers and sisters could Mary and Joseph have had by now? Busy taking care of them, knowing that Jesus was old and mature enough to stay with them?

Could Jesus really have been their only child? \n\n>And what of Matthew 13:55,56? \u201cIs this not the carpenter\u2019s son?

Yes, I think so. When you are told that the Bible is a big book and too difficult for the average person to understand, well that is partly true! But make sure that what you are being taught makes logical sense. Would you believe what you are being taught if you are in a different setting? Or do you simply believe it because of who is saying it? \n\nDon\u2019t fall in that trap! Do Not be mesmerized by the Garb of False Religion.

It's like saying \"yeah God, I know Jesus died for my sins and I believe in You just not enough to trust my life in the hands of someone I can't see or touch especially if this \"\"surrendering\"\" will require that I give up everything I've worked so hard for all these years.\"\n\nThe life of someone who is truly saved will never be comfortable according to standards of the flesh.  Their comfort is a million times better as it is a peace that surpasses all understanding that is given to us by The Creator or the entire universe!!! they will be truly free from all fear, guilt, shame, etc.,   It's a comfort so great that you would be willing to drop everything to follow Him on the drop of a dime.  one who is truly saved no longer sees earthly materials and lifestyles as necessary.

My mom is a champ so she accepted that and stopped bringing me to church.  \n\n\nFast forward to this year when i was invited by my mom to come to the south (of norway) in fredrikstad for a week of a christian hangout calles Oase (or Oasis in english), now as an atheist at the time i just thought about the beaches and said yes. We drove along while almost running out of gas. For the first 3 days i hadn't felt anything, but on the fourth i was sitting on the right side of the hall whilst the band was playing christian music, and i called out to god. 6 times, not loud of course but i shouted in my mind. I waited a long time and felt nothing, i felt betrayed, isolated and left alone. I remember saying i hated you god for betraying me but i love that your people can feel safe with you.  \n\n\nThe next day i was sitting in the middle, absolutely overconfident in my atheism, the band was playing on and then the preacher came on stage, he held his speach (it was really good) but then, he said we were gonna try curing some people today. So he asked everyone that had a sickness, a broken bone, bad eyesight, or just a bad back to stand up and get prayed for.  \n\n\nNow i was too scared to do this myself, but i saw another girl do it, and i just felt like i needed to pray for her, no explanation just needed to, so i went up to her and asked her what she needed god to heal. Asthma, so i prayed, and i prayed hard. Once we were done the preacher got everyone who was prayed for to come forth and tell the hall about it.\n\nI saw her stand up to go the line but eventually deciding against it, once the music came back on i remained seat and dove my head into my hands, worried if i had put pressure on her.  \n\n\nThen i felt a hand on my back.\n\nI had no idea if it was just a guy behind me or god himself stretching down from the heavens to comfort me but i felt it.\n\nEventually the hand dissapeared, (i didn't look back) and i just sat there, pondering almost if i should accept jesus, i sat there for a minute until i stood up and thought to myself that yes, i am a child of god.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy mother was very happy with me when i told her right after and im very happy with my decision, for me it was this sudden want to be used by jesus and spread his word, i didn't imagine myself as a rich economist anymore i envisioned myself speaking to alot of people, a small group of people, one singular person, and telling them about jesus and his good news.", "sentiment": 0.9922}, {"id": "jupni17", "author": "Johninamerica", "parent_id": "15hmrkz", "content": "Please pray [My Daily Prayer](http://www.geocities.ws/gregorian/a).\nIt was written in 1935, and has helped many souls to come to Jesus.\n\nYou have to scroll down the page some, it is not at the top.", "sentiment": 0.4603}, {"id": "jupqkkl", "author": "Lord-Tachanka1922", "parent_id": "jupni17", "content": "Not familiar with this-looks pretty solid theologically, though!", "sentiment": 0.6239}, {"id": "jupo0ck", "author": "Ok_Combination_3002", "parent_id": "15hmrkz", "content": "Romans 10:9. \ud83d\ude01\u2764\ufe0f", "sentiment": 0.0}, {"id": "jupsjwr", "author": "The-Brother", "parent_id": "15hmrkz", "content": "Pray something that comes to your heart asking for Jesus\u2019s will in your life and to be in Christ.

If you genuinely find out if there is nothing false about the Christ and that he doesn't contradict himself, this will help you to believe his teaching comes from God:\n\nJohn 7:16-18 \u2018My teaching is not my own. It comes from the one who sent me. 17 Anyone who chooses to do the will of God will find out whether my teaching comes from God or whether I speak on my own. 18 Whoever speaks on their own does so to gain personal glory, but he who seeks the glory of the one who sent him is a man of truth; there is nothing false about him.'\n\nJust be aware, there are false Christ's and false prophets that are in the Bible that have deceived many including Christianity. A few of Christ's teachings exposing false prophets in the Bible:\n\n1.\tJohn 9:4-5 \u2018As long as it is day, we must do the works of him who sent me. Night is coming, when no one can work.  While I am in the world, I am the light of the world.\u2019\r  \n\r  \n2.\tJohn 4:34 \u2018My food,\u2019 said Jesus, \u2018is to do the will of him who sent me and to finish his work.\u2019 \r  \n\r  \n3.\tJohn 4:37-38 \u2018Thus the saying \u201cOne sows and another reaps\u201d is true. I sent you to reap what you have not worked for. Others have done the hard work, and you have reaped the benefits of their labour.\u2019\r  \n\r  \n4.\tMatthew 11:13 \u2018For all the Prophets and the Law prophesied until John.\u2019 (John the Baptist).\n\n5. John 4:37-38 'Thus the saying \u201cOne sows and another reaps\u201d is true. 38 I sent you to reap what you have not worked for. Others have done the hard work, and you have reaped the benefits of their labour.\u2019\r  \n\n\nThese teachings above from the Christ have a common theme that there is no more teachings from God after the Christ went back to heaven as the Christ finished his Father's work, and there are no more prophets after John the Baptist. \n\nAll the teachings in from Acts to Revelations revolve around the Sign of Jonah, the only sign given to the wicked and adulterous generation: Matthew 12:40 \u2018A wicked and adulterous generation asks for a sign! But none will be given it except the sign of the prophet Jonah. 'For as Jonah was three days and three nights in the belly of a huge fish, so the Son of Man will be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth.' \n\nThis sign, which includes the death, sacrifice and resurrection of the Son of Man will not give you eternal life.\n\nThe sacrifice will not stop you from sinning and being nor will your sins be forgiven. Matthew 9:13 \u201cI desire mercy, not sacrifice.\u201d For I have not come to call the righteous, but sinners.\u2019\r  \n\r  \nBut the words that the Christ spoke are life. John 6:63 'The Spirit gives life; the flesh counts for nothing. The words I have spoken to you \u2013 they are full of the Spirit and life.' The sacrifice, death and resurrection pertains to the flesh which counts for nothing.\n\nIf you accept and practice the Christ's spoken WORDS you will not be condemned and have life:\r  \n\r  \nJohn 12:48 'There is a judge for the one who rejects me and does not accept my words; the very words I have spoken will condemn them at the last day.'\r  \n\r  \nMatthew 7:24-27 \u2018Therefore everyone who hears these words of mine and puts them into practice is like a wise man who built his house on the rock. 25 The rain came down, the streams rose, and the winds blew and beat against that house; yet it did not fall, because it had its foundation on the rock. 26 But everyone who hears these words of mine and does not put them into practice is like a foolish man who built his house on sand. 27 The rain came down, the streams rose, and the winds blew and beat against that house, and it fell with a great crash.\u2019\r  \n\r  \nStart a chat with me if you more me to elaborate", "sentiment": 0.9844}, {"id": "juqh39f", "author": "hagosantaclaus", "parent_id": "15hmrkz", "content": "Repeat the following, and say it out loud, with meaning, and feeling, as if you truly mean it and will it to be true.

Yes, Jesus is God and can save both, and yes, if throwing yourself in the tracks to save both was an option then absolutely that is what Jesus would do.  But those are both cheats in an ethical thought experiment.  \n\nThe trolley problem exists to probe into a person\u2019s ethical system, into the HOW and WHY we make ethical decisions.  There are only two choices.  Finding third choices invalidates the whole point of the question.\n\nIs a person\u2019s ethical system instinctive, emotional, individualistic, or fatalistic?  Then they will probably say it is better to do nothing and let the three people get run over..  Someone whose ethical system is more systematic, rational, community-based or have a stronger belief in human agency will say to pull the lever, because clearly one death is better than three.  \n\nChristian ethics are entirely based in the two great commandments \u2014 love God with all your heart and soul and love your neighbor as yourself.  It is possible under that ethical framework to reach either conclusion.\n\nFor example, love of neighbor affirms the fundamental sacredness of all human life, and is the foundation of a huge amount of Christian ethics.  Three human lives IS more valuable than one.  In the pure trolly problem, if there is truly just throwing the railroad switch, then it is better to do so.\n\nHowever, in ethical terms, the love of God translates into a desire to live in communion with the Divine (we\u2019ll get to that later) and to obey God\u2019s revealed commands.  One of those commands is \u201cDo Not Murder.\u201d  Since pulling the trigger could be construed as an active form of murder, a person could make an argument that they should not do so.  The other three deaths are tragic, but one should not do evil to prevent tragedy.  \n\nThis may seem silly, because there\u2019s nothing fundamentally evil about throwing a railroad switch.   But in real life, that\u2019s not how the trolley problem actually plays out, is it?  Real life trolley problems tend to be more \u201cshould we assassinate this terrorist in order to save his future victims?\u201d  That is moral calculation that led to throwing the switch on the Hiroshima bomb. \n\nRemember, Jesus did face a kind of trolly problem when the devil tempted Him in the desert.  The devil told Him, if you kneel to me, I will put the whole world under your direct dominion.  If Jesus was the worldly ruler of the world, He could have thrown all the switches.  He could have saved His beloved disciples from terrible deaths.  He could have saved Jerusalem from a brutal and bloodthirsty Roman attack.  He could have saved hundreds of thousands of lives, if He just knelt.  And He did not.\n\nThis leads us to the final part of the puzzle, which is the love of God which leads to communion with the Divine which leads to the guidance of the Holy Spirit.  Everyone wants ethics to be a cut-and-dried black-and-white do-and-don\u2019t matrix, but it isn\u2019t.  It is situational, it is complex.  The real answer is to pray constantly, to learn and think about what is good and right under the guidance of the Holy Spirit.  Like a child learning from a parent, this will help us to develop our moral consciences, which are the voice of God within us, and will hopefully lead us to the right conclusion.

No serious Christian thinker posits that the rules are the rules because God is a great cranky lawyer in the sky and just doesn\u2019t like to be crossed.  We all agree that God created the rules that He did because obeying them will lead to our general good.  The entire Gospel and Paula\u2019s epistles point away from following the rules for the rules\u2019 sake. \n\nAnd that leads theists and atheists to the same place, though, in the ultimate trolley question line \u2014 to the problem of information.  God can throw that man in front of the trolley.  God has all of the information; God can see every inch of every decision in the great branching crystal of cause and effect.  We do not.  God can be purely utilitarian.  We can not. \n\nEventually a rational \u201csolution\u201d to the trolley problem train \u2014 will you do it to a criminal, will you do it to save a child \u2014 will boil down to that humility.  If we can know enough to be relatively sure of our choice, then we should act.  If not, we should leave it in God\u2019s hands, knowing that God will choose what is best, even if we cannot see it.

Culpability falls to those who created this impossible problem, and their emphasis on you making that choice is just a way to obfuscate their role.\"\n\nThe way it's given also often ignores other factors, like if people know anybody on the tracks, who and how, the state they're in at the time, and so forth. \n\nEthical problems in life are way more complex than a simple bifurcation of deontology and utility.\n\nIt doesn't matter which of the two choices the person on the trolly makes. Either way the culpability for the death(s) fall to the trolly company, the lack of regulations that have permitted people to get tied up, and whoever put them there. Either way the operator is going to feel guilty, and the above is likewise culpable for their psychiatric care to deal with that guilt.\n\nOutside of trollies, we can see this similarly: is it wrong to steal a loaf of bread to save a starving child? Whatever you do you'll feel guilty. Either way it's an impossible choice. Either way culpability falls to a society that forces individuals to choose between theft of bread and watching a young one starve. \n\nLove others the way you would hope others would love you. Treat everyone the way you would your own children. Sometimes that means utility. Sometimes that means deontology. \n\nBut really, if we're actually on a trolly and have to act that quickly we've left ethics far behind anyway. That's the realm of morality. Morality is what gets you to jump in a river to save a drowning child. Ethics is the discussion over whether the river should have a fence put up. Law is if anyone should get fined or jailed for it.\n\nIf I'm on a trolly and suddenly see people on the tracks, there's no time for ethics. It's whatever morality is ingrained acting on automatic.

He could have told her \"I'll be right back\", gone to Jarius' house, healed his daughter, and then gone back to the woman and healed her. This is not an example of Jesus' finding the \"third way\", it's an example of Jesus being bad with prioritization and time management.\n\n* As Jesus indicates, he didn't heal the unclean woman, she healed herself: \"Daughter, your faith has healed you\". In other words, Jesus didn't need to stop and talk to her at all, since that wasn't required for her to be healed.

The purpose of the problem is to give us a framework for discussing real-world moral dilemmas using a simple example.\n\nYour (anyone else's) inability to cope with the fact that moral dilemmas really do occur is demonstrated by your avoiding the trolley problem. In other words, every time a Christian says \"Jesus would do something other than the two options given,\" the trolley problem succeeds in its purpose. It sets moral frameworks (such as Christianity) in a clear view, and shows how they resolve such a dilemma.\n\nMany Christians approach the real world by:\n\n- simply refusing to acknowledge its complexity and\n\n- insisting that no conflict can exist in Christian tenets.\n\nTherefore, those same Christians approach the trolley problem the same way - by refusing to acknowledge that a moral dilemma can exist and insisting that the moral principles at play can come into conflict with one another.", "sentiment": -0.9619}, {"id": "jqhiz5x", "author": "TRedRandom", "parent_id": "jqg6zyx", "content": "Yes, you have been forcing a binary question.\n\nI've seen you here under many people's replies saying the same thing; that they don't understand the question, they refuse to acknowledge the idea that a moral dilemma can exist, refuse to acknowledge the complexity of the situation. Etc. etc.\n\nYou expect us to be able to give an answer to that question from the viewpoint of a historical/religious figure, one who we have jackshit on in terms of what they were like as a person from a historical angle. That is the exact same as asking \"what would Confucius think of the Trolley Problem?\". It's a dumb question to begin with.\n\nThe only way we can then see what Jesus may think about the problem by looking at how he reacts to similar yet different questions that are supposed to make you think. He DOES refuse them, He does bulldose right past them. That is literally what he does. \n\nYet you don't like that, even though that's the only answer that we can give you that has any kind of weight behind it. If you're not gonna like the answer many christians will give you, then don't ask.\n\nIn my eyes, you're being just as a disruptive, just as stubborn to accept complexity by forcing only those two binary answers.

That's simply what the trolley problem is. It's a simple example that demonstrates the essential elements of a moral dilemma. It does so by confining the outcomes to two possibilities. If you allow for the possibility of satisfying all moral goods, then it ceases to be a moral dilemma, and therefore it ceases to be the same question.\n\n>You expect us to be able to give an answer to that question from the viewpoint of a historical/religious figure\n\nI never asked anyone to do that.\n\n>by looking at how he reacts to similar yet different questions that are supposed to make you think.\n\nIn the recorded stories about Jesus, he was never asked any questions similar to this one.\n\n>If you're not gonna like the answer many christians will give you, then don't ask.\n\nI didn't.\n\n>you're being just as a disruptive, just as stubborn to accept complexity by forcing only those two binary answers.\n\nThat's not me.
