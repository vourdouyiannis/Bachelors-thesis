But chewing creates aerosol, and this is a few inches from the lung. Also, the virus replicates very well in throat tissue. And low pH values do not inactivate the virus.

If you are a drug company that rolled out probably the most anticipated vaccine of the past 50 years, do you want to have a bunch of bad press due to people who became sick when they inadvertently got 4 total doses of vaccine (2 from study, 2 after EUA)?  \n\nThe distribution issues are non-trivial, but if I understand it correctly, the Pfizer vaccine requires -80C while the Moderna requires -20C.

Guess we gotta take it on the chin :("}, {"id": "foe7zt3", "author": "pm_me_ur_teratoma", "parent_id": "fodnnpl", "content": "Sorry, I started typing all of this out, but I just ended up having more and more things to say.  It ended up as a bit of a wall.  But basically I tried to give some examples of vaccines and the way they work and the reason why what you're saying will not be done.  I'm not offended if you don't read the entire thing.\n\n----\n\nI just think you're a bit confused.  You can't make a vaccine for all coronaviruses.  Coronaviruses are a category of numerous viruses.  We have a coronavirus vaccine for livestock, but it is for one singular coronavirus.  They can still catch other coronaviruses.  That just isn't how vaccines work.  You cannot make a singular vaccine that works against every single virus of a specific class.  Vaccines do not and will never (during our lifetime) work that way.  The way vaccines work is by creating a specific antibody response to a specific pathogen.  Antibodies are specific to a disease, not generic.  Vaccines cannot work broadly, as they would not be trigger a specific antibody response to a specific pathogen otherwise.\n\nI'll use bacteria for an example, since I'm more familiar with naming conventions and certain vaccines.  Neisseria is a genus of bacteria, meaning it's a category of bacteria with relatively similar characteristics, thought to be genetically more related to one another rather than those in the Candida genus, for example.  There are numerous types of Neisseria bacteria.  Among the most significant in huamans are Neisseria gonorrheae (causes the STD gonorrhea) and Neisseria meningitidis (causes a severe, rapidly fatal, and highly contagious meningitis).\n\nCurrently, we have a N. meningitidis vaccine, but vaccines are specific.  It does not and will never affect the other genus of Neisseria, as the bacteria in this genus are too genetically distinct to be affected by a vaccine.  So getting an N meningitidis vaccine has zero affect on your ability to contract N gonorrheae (gonorrhea).  Because again, vaccines do not work broadly.  They are too genetically distinct.  That goes against the very nature of what it means to be a vaccine and how antibodies work.\n\nEven among N meningitidis, there are multiple subtypes of the bacteria, as there often are with any pathogen.  We have vaccines against some of the most common subtypes.  But being vaccinated with subtype A only gives you **zero** protection against subtype B.  Antibodies are a highly highly specific immune response and, even among the same genus, there are too many genetic variations to just have a singular N meningitidis vaccine that works against all types.  You can combine some of the vaccines into a singular shot, yes, but that's not the point.  All of these vaccines needed to be developed separately, even if they are able to combine a few of them physically in the same test tube in the end.\n\nLet's look at another example...HPV (human papilloma virus).  HPV is virtually ubiquitous in humans.  But certain subtypes are known to cause certain types of cancers like cervical cancers.  We currently have a vaccine against some of the subtypes of HPV that cause the greatest incidence of cancer.  But they do not and will never protect against all HPV subtypes.  There are just too many and there is less of a real reason to do so.  Even with the HPV vaccines we have, they had to individually research and create each one.  But again, being vaccinated only against say, HPV type 16, does not give you any protection whatsoever against HPV type 8, for example.  Even if ultimately, you are able to put the HPV 16 and HPV 8 vaccines in the same syringe, it doesn't change the fact that each had to individually be developed.  And no, we will never have a vaccination against all HPV forms.  It just isn't feasible or necessary.\n\nThen you get things like the influenza vaccine, which has to be altered slightly each year because of how frequently and readily the virus mutates.  If SARS-CoV-2 will behave similarly, there will be issues in creating a singular vaccine that will work for more than one year at a time.\n\nAnd then you have certain diseases where our bodies are just unable to maintain a significant immune response for a period of time for whatever reason.  Take rabies, for example.  Rabies is a 99.999999% fatal disease if you catch it.  But, we actually have a vaccine against it!  But the immune response to the vaccine only lasts maybe a year at a time for humans.  So in order to remain immune to the virus, you'd need a yearly vaccine.  We've found that for the general population, this is just far too costly and not really feasible or necessary.  Instead, we've found that it works better to vaccinate our pets (who are more likely to be in contact with animal carriers) and those traveling to endemic areas.\n\nThen, you have some diseases where, unfortunately, we just aren't able to generate that strong of an immune response from the vaccine for some reason.  Some countries vaccinate against Mycobacterium tuberculosis, which causes TB.  Weirdly enough, the vaccine does not give total immunity to the disease, and flat out just doesn't seem to work in adults for some reason.\n\nVery very rarely, catching a certain disease provides cross immunity to another disease, but again, it's very very uncommon.  There was a really popular example people use when talking about this, but unfortunately it escapes my memory, sorry.  But typically, it only offers limited protection instead of 100% immunity anyway.  We know that it doesn't work this way for the entire class of coronaviruses though, as people who have had other forms of coronavirus (colds) are still able to contract COVID-19.\n\nFortunately, for people at risk of pneumonia, there actually is a pneumonia vaccine that covers some of the most common causes of pneumonia, but it can never protect against all forms unfortunately, and you do have to periodically get it again.\n\nSo as you see, vaccines are far more complicated than \"just create a vaccine for every single coronavirus/the category of coronaviruses\".\n\nAnyway, hope this helps a bit."}, {"id": "fof3gq3", "author": "scionkia", "parent_id": "foe7zt3", "content": "Well spoken.

It is, in the grand scheme of things, a fairly small expenditure of cash for a chance at saving a non-trivial number of lives (by getting the roll-out quicker if it does work out)."}, {"id": "frjk8qr", "author": "MonkeyBot16", "parent_id": "frjh5uf", "content": "I know.\nThe problem is that imo people tend to overreact on this specific topics at the minimal sight of skepticism (while I think skepticism is always good in science as it can lead to correct mistakes and improve procedures).\nSo I'm not daring to question the intentions of these researchers when doing this or that affirmation, and of course the media has a lot of responsability in the way the understand and send to their public this kind of information.\nMy point (probably not totally well explained) is that if you are overexposed to attention, you have to accept that this usually will bring you some benefits (better chances of getting funding, maybe more offers of collaboration, better chances of people accepting to take part on your trial...) but it also has some cost (you should accept you will be more exposed to criticism).\n\nRegarding the early production of the vaccine, it doesn't necessarily present a problem itself (not saying that) but it could raise some concerns (and it does on me).\nBut I'm perfectly willing to accept that there might be some different criterias and approaches to this and I don't assume in advance that one has to be more right than the other.\nPersonally, my main concern is that the fact of having the resource ready to deploy, could push to optimistic interpretations of the results, as this difference would result in a loss of money or just the opposite.\nSo I think this introduces a bias on the research. But this is a personal opinion.\nSo, let's say that I'm skeptical about human nature in general and about the specific ambitions of pharma companies, universities and governments. I prefer not to develop this too much as we would fall into politics and other considerations (and it would be a different debate itself), but this is mostly my point.\n\nI'm not specifically concerned about this kind of measures being taken under such an urgent situation like the current one, but the fact that these practices can start to be just assumed with not enough debate and that they might last even when this situation is more controlled.\nThe urgency of the situation demand to be flexible and adapt (and researchers are already doing this worldwide: the timelines have very little to do -much quicker- than any previous one and sharing preprints e.g. was not extended in Medicine until this), but we shouldn't miss the point that long-term decisions and standards should be discussed quietly and urgency is not the best criteria for more solid and effective projections.\nAnd it's a fact that there have been abuses and bad praxis in the past both in research (in general) as in some pharma companies.\n\nAdditionally, I think that a too focus on a vaccine scope could neglect other aspects of the fight against the virus, that could be useful too and could have long-term benefits both for public health and to be prepared for future scenarios.\nSometimes I have the feeling that there's a lot of pressure to sort this out asap and close it, while this would be a terrible mistake. We have to learn and introduce improvements, not only on the clinical trial methodology, but in many other things. Imo, some people are failing to understand this, as they are not seeing the problem from a scientific perspective, so they might not be able to see the bigger picture.\nThis threat was something that was warned in advance several times and we had previous 'warnings' that seem to have been dismissed. We cannot afford to make the same mistake again. For instance, multi-resistant bacteria is a threat possible much scarier than CoV-SARS-2 and clinicians and researchers have been warning about them since long ago.\nWe need to design ambitious strategies to be better prepared, so IMO, the focus on speed can somehow distort the importance of this.\n\nOn the other hand, I work in clinical research, so I'm quite aware that wrong decisions on this topics could lead to decrease general trust in research and in science and the historical precedents show that this can result on a very long-standing damage to public health in general. So, simplistic approaches tend to trigger my skepticism, as complex problems demand complex solutions.\n\nAs I said, I accept there are other different criterias to mine and there might always be some of level of disagreement, but these issues shouldn't be focused like a soccer game where some people support a team and the other support their adversary.\nDiversity of criteria and points of view can always be constructive and useful to try to achieve scientific consensus.\nI personally support more the approach defended on this article than the ones focused on speed, but I think this is a valid and interesting discussion that ideally should be done rationally and quietly, leaving emotions and sensationalism aside:\nhttps://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-00751-9"}, {"id": "frhzmci", "author": "rookinn", "parent_id": "frhgovl", "content": "I\u2019m sick of this comment.

But said this, I'm currently involved on a few trials about this disease, so my approach is not destructive at all and I believe personal attacks don't add any value to the discussion.\nI have never said that the vaccine is worthless or anything similar.\n\nI just said that I don't think the vaccine looks as promising as was suggested at first, and this is a personal opinion.\nThere was a huge hype and a lot of attention put onto this trial, but there are many others that haven't been receiving the same attention and might be promising too.\n\nThis is what was published (NYT) about a month ago about this trial:\n\n>*The Oxford scientists now say that with an emergency approval from regulators, the first few million doses of their vaccine could be available by September \u2014 at least several months ahead of any of the other announced efforts \u2014 if it proves to be effective.\nNow, they have received promising news suggesting that it might.\nScientists at the National Institutes of Health\u2019s Rocky Mountain Laboratory in Montana last month inoculated six rhesus macaque monkeys with single doses of the Oxford vaccine. **The animals were then exposed to heavy quantities of the virus that is causing the pandemic \u2014 exposure that had consistently sickened other monkeys in the lab. But more than 28 days later all six were healthy**, said Vincent Munster, the researcher who conducted the test.\n\u201cThe rhesus macaque is pretty much the closest thing we have to humans,\u201d Dr. Munster said, noting that scientists were still analyzing the result. He said he expected to share it with other scientists next week and then submit it to a peer-reviewed journal.\nImmunity in monkeys is no guarantee that a vaccine will provide the same degree of protection for humans. A Chinese company that recently started a clinical trial with 144 participants, SinoVac, has also said that its vaccine was effective in rhesus macaques. But with dozens of efforts now underway to find a vaccine, the monkey results are the latest indication that Oxford\u2019s accelerated venture is emerging as a bellwether.*\n\nOf course, we shouldn't take final conclussions from early results in monkey and we should wait for the results in humans.\nBut I personally think that these latest results don't totally match with what it was originally said.\nMarketing is important for clinical trials, as you need to look attractive to get funding and participants, but in my opinion they might have went to far at some stages with this specific trial.\nThere's obviously a lot of pressure and even anxiety to get an effective vaccine asap, but emotions shouldn't be mixed with rationality on these kind of debates.\nAnd the fact of getting downvoted just for expressing that IMO the trial doesn't look as promising as originally sold to the press kinda proves me this point.\n\nI might be totally wrong (i don't dismissed that) but I'm open to be corrected if that's the case. I can't understand why would anybody take this opinion as an offense or a personal attack against them.\nRaising questions shouldn't be an issue in science."}, {"id": "frihxt3", "author": "deGrominator2019", "parent_id": "fri8xtn", "content": "Enjoy being sick then."}, {"id": "frggo39", "author": "Faggotitus", "parent_id": "frg0dw6", "content": "No it is not.

Contract to popular belief, a vaccine isn't a magical shield. You can still get symptoms when exposed to the virus, it's just much much more mild and for a much shorter duration. So if you expose a few thousand vaccinated young adults to this virus, they can still have mild symptoms, such as a few sniffles, or even a short fever.  This vaccine primes your immune system for a battle--but **that battle still occurs** and hopefully it's over with so quickly that you have no symptoms, or it was just a few sniffles that you thought were allergies.\n\nBut that doesn't tell us anything if upwards of 30% of SARS-CoV-2 infections are already asymptomatic to begin with, and another 50% infections are only very mild in nature. We can't definitively tell whether they recovered quickly because they had the vaccine or just because they're young and healthy. You can even still test positive with an RT-PCR test after being vaccinated. And you can also spread it to other people unknowingly if you were given the virus up your nose and you sneezed on the way home. It's not practical to fully isolate thousands of people for 14-28 days.\n\nThe alternative is to give the challenge to older adults at a large number (N=1000+) where we could truly see if the disease progressed to pneumonia or worse.  The problem here is that if the vaccine doesn't work, then you've just either killed a lot of older people or at best, you've overwhelmed the healthcare system and many other people will die who can't get an ICU bed. The safer and more scientific way is collecting blood plasma and finding neutralizing antibodies which can easily be tested against *in vitro*. That's the money shot, and that can be done without a challenge trial. So far in the Moderna trial, everyone that they've tested so far has developed nAbs that can defeat SARS-CoV-2. I'm fairly confident that they're seeing the same in this Oxford trial otherwise they wouldn't be moving to Phase 2. \n\nTLDR: Blood tests are more accurate and safe than challenge trials for this particular virus."}, {"id": "frg0cw3", "author": "Fairhold", "parent_id": "frfzmfw", "content": "That's would be extremely unethical and especially deathly to the people who got the control vaccine that would contract the virus and got severely ill."}, {"id": "frg2ksi", "author": "VakarianGirl", "parent_id": "frg0cw3", "content": "As far as I know, people are literally lining up out the door not only to take this vaccine and be a part of the study, but also to be challenged with the virus.

The vaccine causes some kind of immune super-response that makes severe disease more likely even as it protects most people (i.e. your chance of severe disease increases when vaccinated).\n2. The vaccine guards against more moderate cases but there is something about more severe cases that evades the vaccine. Thus a vaccinated person who would otherwise get a severe case still gets a severe case (i.e. your chance of severe disease is unchanged regardless of whether you are vaccinated).\n3. The vaccine provides 94 percent protection against disease but the percentage of people among those who get sick who go on to get severe disease is the same (i.e. your chance of severe disease is reduced by 94 percent)\n4. The vaccine provides 94 percent protection against disease AND the remaining six percent are still less likely to get severe disease (i.e. your chance of severe disease is reduced by 98 percent). \n\nIt seems like the Moderna data points to 3 or 4 but there aren't enough cases yet to know yet which one. Severe disease is still uncommon enough and the vaccine is overall effective enough that we don't know if it's further limiting severe disease beyond its extremely high regular efficacy.\n\nInterestingly, the Oxford vaccine, which had a much higher number of vaccinated people with symptoms, still had no severe disease.

It's pretty much the backbone of the statistics that lets all this work so well, and this is also why randomized drug trials are considered much stronger than observational ones.\n\n> And when they say that the vaccine was 95% effective, what if people in the vaccine group did develop covid but either had mild covid with few symptoms (didn't report them) or reported them but tested negative for covid (not uncommon due to the high false negative rate).\n\nIf it's due to the false negative rate, then as I said the randomization means the same thing should've occurred in the control group too - which it didn't. And if it's the first one happening only in the vaccine group, _caused_ by the vaccine, that's still fine - that means you'll only develop very mild covid and not be serious.

I have read different research studies around coronavirus that were in fact not all that well randomized. One example would be the early studies on antibodies where volunteers to get tested for antibodies were not representative of the population and were rather self selected groups of people that were more likely to have had the disease. \n\nCovid is new.

You can't assume that this happened in the control group too because the vaccine could have reduced symptoms. Mild covid can still cause long term complications. Mild and asymptomatic cases are in fact the #1 cause of spread. That's the point. People with mild cases don't even know they have it so they aren't necessarily as careful about wearing masks, being around others."}, {"id": "ge9xk0m", "author": "raddaya", "parent_id": "ge9utmh", "content": "The antibody studies were effectively studies of convenience, drawing from blood donors and/or HCWs, whoever was easily accessible - they specifically were not randomized properly, and they were criticised for this repeatedly. To randomize them, you would need to collect blood samples from volunteers, which would take a very long time for something which is effectively a one-off blood draw (unlike a treatment or vaccine trial) - it doesn't make sense to put that much effort if you can simulate results from a semi-random draw. Though better seroprevalence studies have been done, but anyway.\n\nLarge, decently conducted medical trials are rarely that. A drug trial or a vaccine trial will practically _always_ be properly randomized. Now it's certainly within the realms of possibility that they screwed up - and this will be noticed either in peer review, or by the FDA/EMA/etc during approval - this is one of the things they test for. But in general, it's a _completely_ different kind of study than the antibody studies - them randomizing poorly would be completely shocking and ruin the reputations of everyone involved completely.\n\n> . Mild covid can still cause long term complications. Mild and asymptomatic cases are in fact the #1 cause of spread.\n\n1) The primary aim of the vaccines is to prevent severe infection and deaths. This is obviously where they'll have the strongest data; the other data is still promising but less strong, and it's impossible for it to be strong without testing every participant ever weak (which apparently Oxford did in the UK, but won't be doing in the US.) Therefore, even if the vaccine reduced symptoms and did nothing else, they've already done what they want to. But on top of that, participants have to keep weekly medical diaries and get tested - missing mild cases is again unlikely under these conditions.\n\n2) That statement is just misleading at best; the long term complications of covid have been shown to be heavily correlated to the severity of infection. And no, _presymptomatic_ spread is the major threat; those who are completely asymptomatic spread it very very little compared to presymptomatic or those with symptoms [(source)](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/jz87nd/what_the_data_say_about_asymptomatic_covid/). On top of that, studies in fact show that those with more symptoms are likely to spread more.\n\nSo, that's the bottom line - until and unless someone _actually_ finds a flaw in the randomization, which would be extremely unlikely, it's quite unreasonable to think it's not. But you're perfectly free to wait for a peer review or the FDA to confirm it - nobody's getting injected before that. And EVEN IF despite all the protocols it's missing tons of mild cases (and remember, the medical diaries) - then you still succeeded in your primary aim of stopping severe infections and thus hospitalizations and deaths, therefore turning covid into simply another circulating coronavirus.
